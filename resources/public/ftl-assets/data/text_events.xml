<text name="event_REBEL_AUTO_PDS_c2_choice">(Simple Hacking) Confuse the Anti-Ship Battery's targets.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_AUTO_PDS_c2_text">You spot a weakness in the targeting satellites. Your crew is able to launch a hacking drone to periodically confuse the ASB's lock signal. It should sometimes fire on the Rebel ship now.</text>

<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_SEARCH_1_text">You find a single store that responds to your hails: "Don't open any wide band channels. We'll sell to you but we don't want to draw attention to ourselves."</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_SEARCH_2_text">Your search for a friendly marketplace yields no results but after a time a small shuttle approaches. They release some supplies in your direction with the message, "We are not all friends of the Rebel fleet. Stay strong."</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_SEARCH_3_text">You apparently spoke to the wrong person in your search for a store. Warnings go off and you detect an automated Rebel ship moving in to attack.</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_c1_choice">Search among the stores to see if someone will sell to you.</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_c2_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_c2_text">You decide it's better to not push your luck and move on.</text>

<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_c5_text">You locate the source of the announcement and 'convince' the speaker to rescind his previous statement. In addition he apologizes by offering considerable complimentary supplies. Hopefully you will have enough time to shop before he can figure out what just happened.</text>
<text name="event_STORE_REBELSIDE_text">You come across a large trade station. However, as soon as you approach a warning goes out to all ships in the region: "Do not associate with the Federation sympathizer. All who oppose the Rebels will be punished."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_PULSAR_TEXT_1">Sensors go wild as a nearby pulsar is detected. While you are attempting to recalibrate the FTL drive, a pirate sneaks up on your ship, weapons charging. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_PULSAR_TEXT_2">You arrive to find a pulsar dominating the view screen. You see a small silhouette pass in front of the star. Before you can ponder what it is, warning signals go off. It appears to be a ship in a firing trajectory!</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_PULSAR_TEXT_3">A small research station orbits a nearby pulsar. It appears largely abandoned, but you detect power signatures flaring up as soon as you're in scanning distance. A small combat ship launches from the station. Pirates!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_PDS_TEXT_1">As soon as you arrive multiple warnings go off. A hostile automated ship is detected and an Anti-Ship Battery begins firing. This doesn't look good!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_PDS_TEXT_1">You're shocked to discover a Rebel forward base on this planet. A patrol ship moves in to intercept and sensors indicate an Anti-Ship Battery is about to fire. We've got to get out of here!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_PULSAR_TEXT_1">A Rebel captain appears on the screen. "I thought we had been doomed to backwater assignments. This is my chance to get back in Command's good graces! Charge the weapons!"</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_PULSAR_TEXT_2">A small rebel research station overlooks a pulsating star. Before you can react a Rebel ship spots you and moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_PULSAR_TEXT_3">You arrive at an infrequently used beacon close to a pulsar. Before long a Rebel ship happens to jump nearby. Looks like you'll have to fight.</text>

<!-- data/dlcEventsOverwrite.xml -->
<text name="event_OVERRIDE_FEDERATION_BASE_ASSIST_1_text">You arrive in the sector to see a small outpost being bombarded by an automated drone. This must be the Federation base you were told about!</text>
<text name="event_OVERRIDE_FEDERATION_BASE_ASSIST_3_text">You arrive in the sector to see the Federation outpost under fire from multiple Rebel ships. However, as you approach they get their Anti-Ship Battery online and disable two of the smaller ships. You swoop in to assist, taking down the wing leader.</text>
<text name="event_OVERRIDE_FEDERATION_BASE_ASSIST_4_text">You arrive in the sector to see a small Federation outpost using their Anti-Ship Battery to fire at an automated drone. Debris from other ships is strewn around the area. It looks like the brunt of the battle is already over. You move in to assist.</text>
<text name="ship_REBEL_FEDERATION_PDS_deadCrew_text">With the crew dead, you scrap the ship.</text>
<text name="ship_REBEL_FEDERATION_PDS_destroyed_text">You scrap the wreckage.</text>
<text name="ship_REBEL_FEDERATION_PDS_escape_text">After watching their squadron get destroyed, it looks like their leader is prepared to turn tail and run.</text>
<text name="ship_REBEL_FEDERATION_PDS_gotaway_c1_text">With the threat gone, you contact the Federation outpost. They respond, "Our location has been compromised! Take everything you can and please drop our survivors off at the next station." One soldier offers to stay and fight.</text>
<text name="ship_REBEL_FEDERATION_PDS_gotaway_text">The Rebel ship jumped away.</text>

<!-- data/dlcEvents_anaerobic.xml -->
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_LIST_1_text">You are able to retrieve a significant amount of data about the surrounding beacons from the scout before you scrap it.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_LIST_2_text">You find the ship has a built-in method of warning the Rebel fleet of contact with your ship. You feed it some false data about your ship's whereabouts that should keep the fleet off your tail for a time.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_c1_choice">Fight the ship.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_c1_text">You power up your weapons, which quickly gets the attention of the ship.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_c2_choice">Leave them alone.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_c2_text">Whatever assistance the disabled scout could provide is not worth the risk of fighting another Lanius. You prepare to move on.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_AUTO_REBEL_text">You come across a Lanius ship in the process of absorbing a Rebel automated scout. If you scare off the Lanius you could probably make use of it.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_ASK_1_c1_choice">Give them 30 scrap.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_ASK_1_c1_text">You release the material out of the airlock and the Lanius quickly collect it and start melting it down. They are grateful for your assistance and send over a ship augmentation.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_ASK_1_c2_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_ASK_1_text">After a long message the translator is only able to spurt out "critical... must... metal..." You can only surmise they are desperate for scrap.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_ASK_2_text">You begin to message the ship but it quickly powers on its weapons defensively. It appears to be fully functional and looking for a fight!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_LEAVE_1_text">You prepare to jump as soon as possible. You don't want to be around if they disable this beacon.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_LEAVE_4_text">You make preparations to jump but are surprised when the Lanius ship pulls away from the beacon towards you. It appears to be fully operational!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_SCRAP_1_text">You release the material out of the airlock and the Lanius quickly collect it and start melting it down. They are grateful for your assistance and send over a ship augmentation.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_SCRAP_2_text">You release the scrap out of the airlock and they greedily collect it. Shortly afterwards their impulse engines flicker on and they power up their weapons. It appears you haven't sated their lust for metal!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c1_choice">Ask if they require assistance.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c2_choice">Send them 30 scrap.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c3_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_c1_choice">Give them 30 scrap.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_c1_text">You release the material out of the airlock and the Lanius quickly collect it and start melting it down. They are grateful for your assistance and send over a ship augmentation.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_c2_choice">Give them 6 missiles.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_c3_choice">Give them 6 drone parts.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_c4_choice">Decline.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_choice">(Lanius Crew) Ask if they require assistance.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c4_text">After a time you are told they were damaged and unable to repair their ship due to a lack of metal. They offer to exchange a piece of their ship's equipment for some scrap or other useful materials.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c5_choice">(Hull Repair Drone) Send a drone to help.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_c5_text">As soon as the drone gets close, a Lanius in a type of spacewalk maneuvering unit grabs it and immediately starts breaking it down for metal. You prepare for a fight but they appear quite grateful for the act. They start to use the metal to repair key portions of their ship. From what you can understand from the translator it appears one of their crew wishes to join you.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BEACON_EATER_text">You detect a damaged vessel docked with the jump beacon. It appears the Lanius are absorbing metal from the beacon, risking destroying it and becoming stranded.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BOARDERS_PDS_LIST_1_text">After your skirmish the fighting dies down and you're contacted by the planetary defense team. "Sorry you got caught up in that fight, stranger. No matter how many of these monsters we blow out of the sky they just keep coming. We can patch up your ship for you."</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_BOARDERS_PDS_LIST_2_text">You finish off your assailant with the help of the Anti-Ship Battery but the fight rages on in the distance. You'd best leave before you get dragged into it again.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_c1_choice">Attack the Lanius ship.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_c1_text">You charge your weapons, which quickly gets the Lanius ship's attention.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_c2_choice">Avoid the conflict.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_c2_text">Unfortunately it is not your mission to save every person affected by this war or the Lanius invasion.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DEAD_CREW_1_text">There are no more life-signs remaining on the ship. You strip it of useful materials.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DEAD_CREW_6_text">With the Lanius dispatched you are able to take the fuel out of storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DEAD_CREW_7_text">Now that the Lanius ship has been emptied of hostiles, you search it. Eventually you find a prisoner who offers to join your crew.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DEAD_CREW_8_text">You find a drone schematic on their ship. With no crew to stop you, you can install it on your own.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DESTROYED_1_text">The ship explodes, leaving behind a collection of useful scrap material.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DESTROYED_4_text">The ship explodes, revealing their cargo of unprocessed metal. You collect a significant amount of scrap.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_EMPTY_text">You arrive at the location of the distress signal prepared for a fight, but on first glance it's entirely empty. The signal is coming from a small plastic satellite orbiting a moon. A looping message describes how settlers have recently abandoned the area due to the Lanius threat. You fail to find any other signs of a settlement nearby.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_LANIUS_1_text">After a discussion that your translator fails to comprehend, the enemy ship powers down its weapons. You learn that your crewmember sucessfully reminded them of their treatise promising to leave the property of sentient aliens alone. If this is a widespread rule of this race, there appear to be many who disagree with it. You attempt to hail the civilian ship now that it's safe.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_LANIUS_2_text">The ship refuses all hails, even from one of its own kind. It appears to have gone completely rogue. Before you can react, it begins to target your ship. Prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_c1_choice">Fight the Lanius ship.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_c1_text">You move in to intercept the ship. Detecting a greater threat, the Lanius prepare to fight.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_c2_choice">Avoid the conflict.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_c2_text">Your crew seems unhappy to leave the civilians to such a fate but you try to convince them of the greater good. You don't speak of your own misgivings, however.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_c3_choice">(Lanius Crew) Have your crew admonish their captain.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_FIGHT_text">You immediately do a short-range scan after arriving at the beacon. It appears to be coming from a small civilian vessel under fire from a Lanius ship. Not all Lanius are content with simply scavenging the wrecks of previous battles.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_TOOLATE_text">When you get to the beacon you quickly try to locate the source of the distress call. As you are looking, the signal blinks out. It is then that you notice the small fleet of scavenger ships absorbing debris from a large battle nearby. You can't help but wonder where the distress signal came from, but you decide not to risk pressuring the fleet.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DISTRESS_TRAP_text">You are too late - whatever once was emitting the distress signal from this system drew a Lanius ship as well as your own. Having consumed the original target, the Lanius turn their attention to your vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_EVENT_c1_choice">Scan the ship for lifeforms.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_EVENT_c1_text">As you scan the vessel, the scan frequencies awaken the Lanius crew from hibernation - and they're hungry for raw materials!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_EVENT_c2_choice">Power weapons to attack.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_EVENT_c3_choice">Investigate the vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_EVENT_text">You have picked up a Lanius vessel drifting in this sector. There is no damage to the hull, and it appears to be powered down.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c1_choice">Ignore the vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c2_choice">(Lanius Crew) Send over a Lanius crewmember to plunder the ship of resources.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c2_text">Your crewmember manages to salvage some resources without waking the hibernating crew.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c3_choice">Navigate carefully around the ship and strip what materials from the hull you can.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c4_choice">(Advanced Piloting) Engage the autopilot to strip the ship safely.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_c4_text">The computer matches the rotation and speed of the target ship, and you take the opportunity to gather what residual scrap you can without awakening the Lanius crew. You get an excellent haul!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_INVESTIGATE_text">The vessel appears to be dormant. It is likely there are Lanius on board, but they may be in hibernation until the ship comes within range of new materials.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_PILOT_1_text">As you drift toward the vessel, your piloting skill is unable to match your intent - the Lanius ship powers up, hungry for raw materials!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_PILOT_2_text">You clumsily manage to strip some hull plating before being forced to retreat or risk collision.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_WEAPONS_1_text">You power up your weapons, and in response, the Lanius ship does the same! Prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_WEAPONS_2_c1_choice">Investigate the vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_WEAPONS_2_c2_choice">Destroy and scrap it.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_WEAPONS_2_c2_text">As soon as you lock your weapons onto their vessel, it awakens... they must have been in hibernation and were awoken by the danger!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_DORMANT_WEAPONS_2_text">You power up your weapons, but don't get a response.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_ESCAPE_1_text">The Lanius ship begins to prepare their FTL drive for a jump. They appear to no longer wish to fight.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_ESCAPE_2_text">Scanners indicate the Lanius ship is preparing to jump. Don't let them escape!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FIGHT_ASTEROID_text">This beacon appears to have been set up within an asteroid field to access a mining settlement. However, half of the settlement has been disassembled by a number of Lanius scavengers. Their military escort moves in to scare you off.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FIGHT_PULSAR_text">There appears to be some sort of research station near a pulsar, although it's hard to tell since a portion of it has been melted. The Lanius ship that has been working at it moves in to intercept you, totally oblivious to the threat of EM pulses.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FREE_STUFF_text">You stumble across a badly damaged Lanius craft. It jumps away as soon as it sees you. Looking around the area, you discover a number of destroyed Rebel automated ships. It must have been quite the fight. You scrap what remains.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_END_text">It looks as if the Lanius were uninterested in the fuel reserves on the station, and there is a good amount of fuel left. You take what your ship can hold and prepare to jump to the next beacon.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_1_text">Your ship's dash suddenly lights up with warnings - a hull breach! Lanius were on board the platform and are now on board your ship. A hidden cruiser comes into view!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_2_text">What seemed to be a brief respite turns into a Lanius trap... the first warning is an explosion from your engine room, followed moments later by detection of a Lanius ship at sensor range!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_3_c2_choice">(Improved Sensors) Run another scan at maximum sensitivity.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_3_c2_text">You run an additional more focused scan and find one of the auxiliary refueling platforms has some unclaimed fuel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_3_c3_choice">(Advanced Sensors) Run another scan at maximum sensitivity.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_3_c3_text">You run an additional more focused scan and find one of the auxiliary refueling platforms has some unclaimed fuel and drone parts.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_LIST_3_text">No one answers your hails. You run some scans and discover that the station has been recently abandoned, no doubt due to the threat of the Lanius. You empty their fuel reserves before leaving.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c1_choice">Hail the platform and attempt to communicate.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c1_text">There is a screech from your comm system, and the broadcast suddenly cuts off. The platform suddenly begins to move, revealing itself to be a Lanius ship!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c2_c1_choice">Signal for a refuel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c2_c2_choice">(Blast Doors) Secure your blast doors - best to be safe when docked.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c2_c2_text">Your reinforced doors save you from an attempted ambush by the Lanius, who cluster around the doors and hull, attempting to consume your ship. Coldly, you wipe them out one by one with your weapon array, then take control of the station and take its fuel reserves.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c2_choice">Dock with the platform.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c2_text">Your ship enters one of the refueling station berths, grateful for a rest.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c3_choice">Ignore the platform.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_c3_text">You leave the platform alone, and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_FUELING_STATION_text">You detect a refueling platform near the beacon, although its broadcast signal is garbled, and you can't make out the message.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_LIST_1_text">You try your best to convey the notion that the approaching Rebel fleet has countless automated ships scouting for them. However, either the translation device has failed or they're simply not interested. They cut the channel and continue to absorb the ships.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_LIST_2_text">You try your best to convey the notion that the approaching Rebel fleet has countless automated ships scouting for them. You're not certain if you were misunderstood but they appear to scoff at your suggestion. Most ships continue what they were doing but a single ship moves to fight you.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_LIST_3_text">You try your best to convey the notion that the approaching Rebel fleet has countless automated ships scouting for them. They thank you for the tip and prepare to jump in the direction you came. That will hopefully delay the fleet. You scrap what remains of the Rebel station.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_c1_choice">Try to use them to delay the Rebels.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_c2_choice">Leave them alone.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_c2_text">You decide it would be better to leave them be.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_c3_choice">(Lanius Crew) Try to use them to delay the Rebels.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_c3_text">Your crewmember tells them of the approaching fleet and the number of automated ships they use to scout ahead. They thank you for the tip and prepare to jump in the direction you came. That will hopefully delay the fleet. You scrap what remains of the Rebel station.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_GROUP_AUTO_text">You notice a number of Lanius ships absorbing a forward Rebel base and its automated scouts. They don't seem to be aggressive. Perhaps their desire for metal could prove to be useful?</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_SHIP_LIST_1_text">The competitor gone, you investigate the debris, but it looks as if the Lanius harvested much of it before you arrived.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_SHIP_LIST_2_text">The competitor gone, you proceed to investigate the field and scavenge what you can.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_SHIP_LIST_3_text">It looks like you interrupted the Lanius before they had a chance to scavenge much from the debris, and you make off with a good haul.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c1_choice">Attempt to harvest some for yourself.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c1_text">As you attempt to navigate the debris, you come too close to the Lanius ship - and they proceed to try to harvest you!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c2_choice">(Improved Piloting) Engage the auto-pilot and safely harvest the debris.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c2_text">With help from the computer, you are able to keep a comfortable distance between you and the Lanius ship, and you are able to gather resources from the debris field without conflict.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c3_choice">(Advanced Piloting) Engage the auto-pilot and safely harvest the debris.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c3_text">With help from the computer, you are able to keep a comfortable distance between you and the Lanius ship, and you gather a considerable amount of resources from the debris field without conflict.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c4_choice">Attack the vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c4_text">You go on the offensive and power up your weapons - with any luck, you'll soon have the mineral field all to yourself.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c5_choice">Ignore the vessel.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_c5_text">You charge up your drive and prepare to make the next jump. No sense in antagonizing the Lanius if you don't need to.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_HARVESTER_text">Your scans have picked up a Lanius vessel in this system: it appears to be navigating a rich debris field, harvesting the minerals.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_MANTIS_DISTRESS_END_1_text">The Mantis hiss and click, angry at being saved, and angry at themselves for needing to be saved. They part ways with some scrap metal that is no longer attached to their hull and a few missiles they can no longer use.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_MANTIS_DISTRESS_END_2_text">The Mantis ship has sustained too much damage - there are no survivors. You gather what resources you can from the wreckage.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_MANTIS_DISTRESS_c1_choice">Attack the Lanius ship.</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_MANTIS_DISTRESS_c1_text">The Lanius don't seem to have noticed you yet - but they will. Launching into the fray, you target the Lanius vessel!</text>
<text name="event_LANIUS_MANTIS_DISTRESS_c2_choice">Leave the Mantis to their fate.</text>

The communication originates from the hull of a partially dismantled ship which lies among a number of other destroyed ships. The violent Lanius ship responsible for this carnage is advancing on the survivors.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_TEXT_2">You scan the area after arriving at this system. A Lanius ship is in fast pursuit of an unarmed civilian ship. It's hard to say if it's truly a threat since its weapons are not charging.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_CIVILIAN_TEXT_3">You arrive at the location of a recent battle. Judging from the debris, some settlers attempted to fight off a number of small Lanius ships, although it's impossible to say who instigated the aggression. A few skirmishes can be seen in the distance, but more notably a lone Lanius ship is firing on a heavily damaged civilian vessel.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_1">Sensors indicate a small Lanius cruiser in the process of salvaging another small Lanius ship. Before you have a chance to wonder what caused them to turn on each other, the survivor notices you and moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_10">You have stumbled across a mining expedition - unfortunately, the miners are the Lanius, and they've chosen your ship as their target!</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_2">Shortly after your arrival, a Lanius ship jumps near the beacon. It begins to move slowly toward you. You open wide band communication channels, attempting to make contact. However, it either ignores you or is unable to receive the messages. As they get closer you issue the order to charge weapons and find they do the same.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_3">You receive a message on a wide band frequency, originating from an approaching Lanius ship. It appears not to be directed at you, but your translator does its best all the same: "... metallic opportunity... acquisition... by force..." Looks like you're in for a fight.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_4">A military Lanius vessel stops repurposing an abandoned satellite as soon as you jump in. It blocks all hails and powers its weapons.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_5">The beacon is surrounded by many tiny Lanius craft, surely only capable of holding one occupant. Perhaps they are some kind of forward scout searching for 'metallic opportunities'? As you consider this, a much larger Lanius vessel moves in to engage you, and the scout ships scatter in all directions.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_6">You arrive to see a well-armed Lanius craft preparing to salvage a badly damaged Rebel patrol ship. Noticing your arrival, the Lanius greedily moves in to intercept its second target of the day.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_7">As you arrive in the system, your proximity alarm begins screaming: there is a Lanius ship right on top of you! Before you have a chance to hail, they open fire!</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_8">As you are getting your bearings, another ship suddenly arrives at the beacon - it's the Lanius, and they've marked your ship for salvage!</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_FIGHT_TEXT_9">At first everything seems quiet, then your scanners pick up a ship approaching at high speed - the Lanius have detected your arrival and are powering up their weapons!</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_TEXT_1">You discover an abandoned mining facility in the process of being 'acquired' by the Lanius. However, you immediately receive a call from a civilian transport vessel, "Help! We were trying to escape before the Lanius came only to be caught by pirates!" You see a lone pirate ship boarding the civilian craft.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_TEXT_2">A pirate ship emerges from hiding after you and another ship jump into the area. Sensors show the pirates ran a quick scan of your ship's weapon system before flying off to pursue the unarmed civilian ship.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_TEXT_3">A pirate ship is firing on the small ships docked at a refueling station. They are broadcasting on a wide band channel. You catch the captain's rant mid-speed, "...saw you trading with those damned scavengers. I'll show you what happens when you try and undercut the Red Giant gang!"</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_FIGHT_TEXT_1">A pirate ship appears to be threatening a small refugee ship near the beacon. Upon seeing you jump in, it turns to approach. The civilian wastes no time and jumps away, but that appears only to harden the pirate's resolve.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_FIGHT_TEXT_2">An upgraded pirate ship sits among the remains of a number of Lanius ships. It hails you, "These punks think they can jus' waltz in here into our sector? Obnoxious, right? Well, I'm sure you know the routine, let's do this."</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_FIGHT_TEXT_3">Debris from a number of battleships are scattered around the beacon. As you approach the area a pirate ship thrusts itself through the hulks to attack. It must be using the metal to lure the Lanius into a trap.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_FIGHT_TEXT_4">The pirate ship patroling this sector has been busy. The debris of several Rebel scouts and at least one civilian ship litter the area. "Welcome, welcome, there's room for one more!" The over-confident pirate hails you as he charges his weapons and moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_PIRATE_FIGHT_TEXT_5">The pirate sees you before you see him... prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_1">You arrive to see a number of Rebel ships attempting to dissuade Lanius scavenger ships from "acquiring" their forward station. A passing Rebel patrol ship spots you and moves in to intercept.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_2">A Rebel scout patrols near the beacon. "Hah! I knew you would try to sneak through this sector as soon as I heard it had become treacherous. Surrender!"</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_3">You intercept discussions between a Rebel patrol and a human mining colony, "... we realize you're scared but all reports indicate the metal bastards target abandoned settlements only. If we relocated our fleets based on every request from backwater... wait, what's that..." Before you can react, the channel is cut and the Rebel ship moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_4">You arrive at the beacon and notice a small Rebel ship chasing Lanius scavengers away from a wrecked Rebel battleship. As soon as the Rebel notices you and moves in to attack, the Lanius ships return to their prey like flies on garbage.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_5">A Rebel messages you. "Who would have thought the most wanted ship in the quadrant would just happen by my station? Prepare to meet your maker."</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_REBEL_FIGHT_TEXT_6">Your arrival coincides almost exactly with that of a Rebel ship. It's hard to know who is more surprised, but there is no option but to fight.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SOLO_SALVAGE_TEXT_1">You come across a single Lanius ship salvaging a small civilian craft. You cannot tell if they attacked the craft or just happened upon it.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SOLO_SALVAGE_TEXT_2">There are remnants of a fierce battle here. Scattered among the hulks are small Lanius craft, slowly breaking apart the wrecks. One of the ships is close enough that you could probably attack it without immediately alerting the others.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SOLO_SALVAGE_TEXT_3">When you arrive at the beacon you discover what must have been remnants of a large battle. However the vast majority of metal has been stripped from the ships, only various plastic and other materials float in a ring around a planet. A lone Lanius ship moves between the wreckage looking for more salvage.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SOLO_SALVAGE_TEXT_4">A small asteroid belt is near this jump beacon. It must be mineral-rich since a Lanius ship is docked on a large rock, slowly absorbing parts of it. You could probably get their attention pretty easily.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SOLO_SALVAGE_TEXT_5">A Lanius ship is slowly salvaging what remains of a small research station. It's hard to say if it was abandoned or attacked by the Lanius.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">An image of a silent Lanius captain appears on your monitor. Images of their well-filled cargo hold follow. You come to the conclusion that they are trying to barter for a cease-fire.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The Lanius ship hails you. Your translator struggles, spurting out "Prevent death... Merciful... Penitent...". You believe they are surrendering.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">You receive a hail from the ship followed by a crude translation device spurting, "Stop. Stop. Stop."</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">You receive an image of their captain, silhouetted by the destruction aboard their ship. It bows forward with the metallic appendages about its body doing the same. It appears to be requesting mercy.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_5">Your comms system receives a video feed of the enemy ship's crew waving small makeshift white flags. It appears they have taken research about your culture's customs quite literally.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_6">You receive a message from the enemy ship that your translator struggles to interpret, "Penitence for metal. Offering intention."</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_SURRENDER_TEXT_7">You receive a one word message from the enemy ship, "Surrender." You assume they are asking to surrender rather than demanding your surrender.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_TRADER_TEXT_1">Aided by a modified translator, a nearby Lanius scavenger ship messages you, saying, "Metal sufficient. Request exchange." It appears there are some Lanius who wish sociable interaction with other races.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_TRADER_TEXT_2">A small Lanius craft approaches. You prepare for a fight but they do not seem to be carrying any weapons. After a brief moment they message you, although your translator struggles with the unfamiliar dialect. It appears they wish to trade.</text>
<text name="text_LANIUS_TRADER_TEXT_3">You arrive to find a large Lanius vessel laden with recently collected metal. They are apparently offering to trade for supplies they are lacking.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_1">The charts indicate this was the location of a small skirmish over a military facility on a nearby moon. Oddly, scans pick up no signs of debris from either the battle or the station. Yet another area sucked dry by the Lanius.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_2">Scans show no signs of any ships or settlements nearby. You have no way of knowing if the area was always uninhabited or if it was simply erased by the Lanius.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_3">A few refugee ships are preparing for the long journey to another sector. They explain how a number of Lanius military ships surrounded them and began to hack their FTL drives. Fortunately the Lanius moved on after briefly scanning the civilian ships, leaving them more than a little shaken up.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_4">You pass a civilian ship that warns of the nearby Lanius. "One of them attacked a civilian transport and started to melt their fracking hull. But then the weirdest thing happened... another metal ship actually fired on its companion until it backed off." Apparently there are disagreements among the Lanius about what should be salvaged.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_5">You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few ASB warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_LANIUS_6">You come across a human civilian ship preparing to leave the sector. They message you, "We're getting out of here! There was some cult rambling about the spreading of the disease, Humanitis. They forcefully boarded our ship and tried to open all of our airlocks, shouting, "Be purged!" Is nowhere safe anymore?"</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_LANIUS_1">This sector has been largely abandoned since a series of battles decimated the local population. An unusual alien race is reportedly scavenging in the area. You'd best be on guard.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_LANIUS_2">This sector was the site of many major battles between the Federation and Rebel fleets. Strangely, there's very little evidence of those battles remaining...</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_LANIUS_3">There have been a number of reports of advanced ships salvaging the wrecks and abandoned mining facilities in this sector. Could it be that the Lanius have resurfaced?</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_LANIUS_4">The war tore through this civilian sector, and just recently even the few life signs that remained have begun blinking out. Rumours suggest the Lanius are responsible.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_1">A large transport ship undergoing maintenance hails you. "Greetings, friend. We're getting out of this sector as soon as this Coolant Shaft is fixed and I suggest you do the same. I half expect those damn metal freaks to come and try to melt down our ship at any moment. We're trying to offload some inventory - interested in buying something?"</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_2">You arrive to discover a number of Lanius ships docked at what appears to be a station. You hasten to leave but are relieved when they message you in your language. "Buy? Sell? Traders." Apparently some merchants emigrated with the scavengers.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_3">A trading depot is set up near the beacon. A surprising number of military ships guard the station. You pick up an advertisement on a wide band channel, "Ship parts, repairs, refueling, souvenirs - we got it all. Check out the only store not afraid of scavengers this side of Omacron 6."</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_4">You arrive at an empty space station, no doubt abandoned due to the Lanius threat. Life signatures are detected at the ship depot and you spot a few crude signs stating "Everything Must Go!"</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_5">This beacon is bustling with activity. It looks like some merchants decided to capitalize on the fact that dozens of refugee ships are using this location to recharge their FTL drives. You browse their wares.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_LANIUS_6">You receive a message from a nearby station, "The end is upon us! The metal demons have come to absorb your very being! But it's not too late to prepare for the worst!" It appears that was an advertisement for a space dock. You scan their products.</text>

<text name="event_HIDDEN_FEDERATION_BASE_LIST_4_text">You search near the coordinates given to you, but your search yields no results. Perhaps they were mistaken.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_1_c0_clone">Luckily, your clone bay is able to revive your crewmember.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_1_text">Once back in orbit, the man turns increasingly violent. Eventually he turns on your crew and manages to kill one before you can subdue him.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_2_text">He seems to improve immensely upon getting back to the ship. It might take a while for him to truly be well again, but until then he seems happy to serve as a member of your crew.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_3_text">Being back in space terrifies him. He goes mad and nearly blows a hole in the side of your ship with a makeshift explosive in an attempt to "escape this metal prison." He dies in the explosion.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_4_c2_choice">(Improved Medbay) Quickly bring him to the medbay.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_4_c2_text">Your improved medbay was able to resuscitate him. After a short time he recovers greatly saying, "I really thought I was a goner... I haven't eaten for days. Would you mind if I stayed on your ship?"</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_4_c3_choice">(Improved Clonebay) Quickly register him into the clonebay.</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_4_c3_text">Your quick reaction allowed your Clonebay to revive him after he passes. After he steps out of the machine he states, "How am I alive? Wasn't I just dying on some shuttle? Technology sure has changed."</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_4_text">It seems he was in worse health than we first thought. He collapses on the trip up to the ship. It doesn't look like he's going to make it...</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_SLUG_1_text">You bring the ship closer. The Slug enters a trance-like state for 1 to 2 seconds, then quickly snaps out of it. He states, "This person is clearly unstable. It is best we leave them alone."</text>
<text name="event_MADMAN_SLUG_2_text">You bring the ship closer and the Slug, after a pause, says that the person is stable and with good intentions. You offer a position in your crew and it is graciously accepted.</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_LANDING_PARTY_LEAVE_1_text">As you try to leave, a patrol spots you. Wailing sirens begin to blare around the camp and the ship moves in to attack!</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_LANDING_PARTY_LEAVE_2_text">They must have been focused on setting up camp since you got far enough away to attempt a jump without being noticed.</text>

<text name="event_MERCENARY_WORK_LIST_2_c1_text">"Just be sure not to blow them up!" they say nervously as they direct you to a nearby moon. You find the pirate ship docked there. They immediately respond to your appearance with, "Your money or your life!" They must be new to this.</text>

<text name="event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_LIST_2_text">You find the station and they respond to your hails immediately, saying, "It took you long enough! We have practically no use for these now... I refuse to pay full price, take this and leave the cargo in our holds."</text>
<text name="event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_text">You arrive at the location given to you by the merchant. You are supposed to deliver drone parts to a station here.</text>
<text name="event_MERCHANT_INVESTIGATE_CARGO_LIST_1_text">The cargo was some food and medical supplies, nothing that you need right now. You make a note of the delivery destination in case you want to drop off the cargo for the payment.</text>

<text name="event_MERCHANT_INVESTIGATE_CARGO_LIST_3_text">There were general military supplies in the cargo crates. You take what you can use.</text>
<text name="event_MERCHANT_INVESTIGATE_DELIVER_text">You find the station that had ordered your cargo.

<text name="event_PIRATE_STATION_CROPS_c4_text">The pirate watches as you teleport an incendiary explosive into the settlement. As the settlers scramble to put out the fires, their rudimentary planetary defenses power down. Forcing their surrender was laughably easy, but the pirate seems impressed with your tactics and agrees to share the settlement's 'tribute'.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_STATION_CROPS_text">Scans show a remote settlement being blockaded by a pirate ship. The ship hastily messages you, "Stay out of this, or you'll be next!...Concentrate fire on..."</text>

<text name="event_SATELLITE_DEFENSE_BORING_1_text">You fire a few volleys from a distance and it is clear the defense system is no match for your weapons. However, the station does not seem happy with your 'solution'. You salvage what you can and jump before there is trouble.</text>
<text name="event_SATELLITE_DEFENSE_BORING_2_text">You fire a few volleys but aren't able to penetrate the defense system's shields. Its weapons have no trouble piercing yours though, and you take minor damage before escaping. The station will need to find help elsewhere.</text>

<text name="event_START_GAME_text">The data you carry is vital to the remaining Federation fleet. You'll need supplies for the journey, so make sure to explore each sector before moving on to the next. But get to the exit before the pursuing Rebel fleet can catch up!</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_DRONE_LIST_1_text">You send your Anti-Personnel drone to explore the station. What you find is disconcerting... It appears that something has caused the scientists and guards to tear each other to pieces. You abandon the drone on the station for fear that it is contagious.</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_DRONE_LIST_2_text">Once on board the station, your drone is immediately beset by frenzied scientists and guards. It eventually gets torn apart by the mob but it has bought you enough time to disengage from the station and escape into empty space.</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_DRONE_LIST_3_text">The cameras mounted to your Anti-Personnel drone show a chaotic scene. No people are to be found but the remnants of a recent battle on-board the ship are obvious. You instruct the drone to retrieve some useful materials before leaving.</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_LIST_1_text">Inside there are signs of a great struggle; scientists lie dead where they fell, brutally dismembered. You grab a few research drone parts lying on a desk near the door and leave quickly.</text>

<text name="event_STATION_SICK_LIST_3_text">As you explore the base, crazed screams are heard. Your team retreats back to your ship with a number of armed scientists in pursuit. One of your team starts to cough and falls in a spasm onto the floor.</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_SCANNER_1_text">Sensors show scattered signs of life although most of the crew are deceased. However the health signatures of the living indicate they are violent and unstable. You decide it's better to move on than risk engaging the remaining crew.</text>
<text name="event_STATION_SICK_SCANNER_2_text">There are no life signs detected on the ship although there appears to be a number of deceased crew. There does not appear to be any airborn contagions so your crew quickly salvages what they can before moving on. You can only wonder what befell the station.</text>

<text name="ship_PIRATE_QUEST_CREWDEAD_destroyed_text">The explosion rocks the pirate ship and a brilliant light begins to shine from the wreckage. Before you can react the ship is consumed in a massive chain of explosions that send you careening toward a nearby planet. You struggle to put out the fires and your pilot desperately tries to get the controls online before you're dragged down to the surface.

<text name="text_FIND_DRONE_2">An abandoned space station circles a lonely planet. A quick check yields schematics for a drone. You bring it aboard the ship.</text>
<text name="text_FIND_DRONE_3">Federation sympathizers contact you as you arrive. "We know your mission should be secret, so don't ask how we know about it. Take this schematic, it's all we can do to help."</text>
<text name="text_FIND_DRONE_4">A small Engi research vessel is trying to fend off a Mantis ship. You move in to engage, but after a quick scan of your ship the Mantis ship retreats. The Engi offer you a drone schematic as thanks for your timely arrival.</text>
<text name="text_FIND_DRONE_5">You find an abandoned mining station on a nearby moon. A quick scan shows no life forms; however, you discover a usable drone schematic!</text>

<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_1">Holy crap! A weapon is just floating in space!</text>
<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_2">You inform a nearby station of your flight from the Rebels. They offer to outfit your ship with a weapon and wish you well.</text>
<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_3">A settlement still loyal to the Federation hails your ship. They have prepared a weapon to aid your escape from the Rebels.</text>
<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_4">As soon as you arrive a small Mantis ship detaches from a wreck and jumps away. You must have interrupted their salvage operation because you find a weapon ready to be installed!</text>
<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_5">A small merchant ship messages you, "Underground Federation comm channels are all talking about your 'secret' mission. Let us install a weapon to help. Good luck!"</text>
<text name="text_FIND_WEAPON_6">Debris from a battle is scattered around this system. A few pieces bounce against your ship. You passively scan them and discover there is a functioning weapon among them!</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_1">You arrive in a system and immediately discover a pirate ship nearby. Strangely, scans indicate there are no lifeforms aboard. You salvage anything useful, but find no clue as to the whereabouts of the former crew.</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_2">Not much remains in this abandoned system; however, scans reveal a nearby mining platform with some salvageable materials.</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_3">As you arrive in the system you are hailed by a loyalist settlement. Upon learning of your quest, they offer you supplies.</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_4">Debris from a forgotten battle still orbits the gas giant in this system. Some of it still might be usable.</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_5">You receive a message from a nearby station, "A Federation cruiser jumping into Rebel territory? Quite the bold move." You quickly move to arm the weapons but he continues, "Lucky for you we're not all in support of the Rebellion. Perhaps these supplies will help you get to friendlier space alive."</text>
<text name="text_FREE_ITEMS_6">You happen upon the remains of a space station. It has been mostly picked clean but there appears to be a few materials that will aid you in your mission.</text>
<text name="text_FRIENDLY_BEACON_1">"Greetings! It is so good to see you! We've been out of fuel and floating out here for weeks. We were terrified a pirate or those damn Rebels would find us first. Could you spare some fuel?"</text>
<text name="text_FRIENDLY_BEACON_2">You arrive to find a ship floating among some debris. "Hello. Our impulse drives are shot and we can't jump. Could you give us some fuel?"</text>
<text name="text_FRIENDLY_BEACON_3">A small civilian ship flies over as soon as you arrive. You're prepared to fight but they just inform you that they're out of FTL fuel and can't jump.</text>
<text name="text_FRIENDLY_BEACON_4">"Hello. We used our last FTL fuel to jump to this station." They indicate a burnt out husk of debris and warped metal. "As you can see the war must have spread to this sector. We've been stranded ever since."</text>
<text name="text_FRIENDLY_BEACON_5">The ship emitting the distress beacon messages you, "Sorry to bother you, but we're out of fuel and can't get out of this barren sector. Could you help us out?</text>
<text name="text_FUEL_FOR_DRONE_1">A nearby space station hails you. "Greetings! Your arrival is most fortuitous. We recently came across some extra drones. If you have some fuel, perhaps we can make a deal?"</text>
<text name="text_FUEL_FOR_DRONE_2">A strange vessel approaches. A digital message appears on your view-screen: "This is an automated merchant. Refill this vessel with fuel and it will supply you with drones."</text>
<text name="text_FUEL_FOR_DRONE_3">You arrive in the sector and are greeted by a science vessel waiting by the beacon. They hail you, "We find ourselves low on fuel and have a proposition."</text>
<text name="text_GAMEOVER_1">The last hope of the Federation dies as your ship breaks apart.</text>
<text name="text_GHOST_SHIP_TEXT_1">This beacon lies in an empty section of space. You almost move on before spotting a heavily damaged ship drifting nearby. The ship's markings are unfamiliar.</text>
<text name="text_GHOST_SHIP_TEXT_2">You share this beacon with just one other ship, but it appears ancient and long since abandoned.</text>
<text name="text_GHOST_SHIP_TEXT_3">Another ship is jumping away just as you arrive. They send out a quick communication before their jump completes: "That ruined bulk is more trouble than it's worth." You see a drifting, abandoned vessel nearby.</text>
<text name="text_GHOST_SHIP_TEXT_4">There's a heavily damaged ship at this beacon. You briefly pick up a very distorted communication from the ship but are unable to understand it. Your sensors detect no life-signs.</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_1">You find a mercenary for hire at this Beacon. Their unique skills can sometimes prove to be useful.</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_2">A mercenary hails you: "Greetings, friend! We've heard tell of your quest and are here to offer our valuable services."</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_3">There's a ship with pirate markings orbiting the nearby planet. You receive his hail: "Anything is possible, for the right price."</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_4">The captain of this ship claims he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_5">Mercenaries are swarming the galaxy now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. One is waiting at this beacon and hails you.</text>
<text name="text_MERCENARY_6">A ship hails you: "Good sir! It seems you're having some troubles with the Rebels. I'd like to help you, but I can't afford the upkeep required on this hunk of junk I'm flying... maybe we can come to an arrangement?"</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_1">Your jump leads you to nothing but empty space. This Jump Beacon serves no purpose other than as a connection.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_2">You jump into an unremarkable system. No life signs detected within scanning range.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_3">Your scans reveal a mining base on a nearby planet long since abandoned. No life signs detected.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_4">Your scans reveal an ore refinery and several factories, all standing still and empty. No life signs detected.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_5">You discover a nearby planet speckled with settlements, although none respond to your hails.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_6">This beacon has been built for a nearby civilian space-station. No one hails your ship.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_7">The nearby planet shows sign of habitation and great beauty. A rudimentary automated planetary defense system is looping its message into space: "Warning! Quarantine Level 5 in effect under FHA Act 22, article 11.2. Warning! Quarantine Level 5..."</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_8">Your jump leads to a completely unremarkable binary star system. There is nothing else around.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_9">Your jump leads to a remarkable binary star system. The view is beautiful, but there is nothing else around.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">"Alright, you win! Here's some equipment from our stores, leave us alone!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_10">"You have made your point, we are beaten. Take these and leave us to our shame."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_11">"Take everything we have and let's both forget this happened."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_12">They send you a message: "I cannot believe how well equipped your ship is! Please take this and let us live."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_13">"Please don't kill us. We'll give you everything we have!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_14">"The day is yours! Show us your honor by allowing us to leave with our lives."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The ship repeatedly hails you. It looks like they want to surrender.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">"You are considerably more well-armed than I would have thought. We surrender."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">They send you a message: "Your ship is surprisingly well equipped! Please take this and let us live."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_5">"Please don't kill us. We will give you everything we have!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_6">They offer you some of their cargo if you let them live.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_7">They offer to give you some of their goods if you don't destroy their ship.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_8">You get a frantic message, "Take everything we have! Just don't kill us."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_9">"You have clearly bested us. We merely request our lives."</text>
<text name="text_QUEST_ESCORT_TEXT_1">After a short time you receive a message, "Hello. I hope it's not a bother, but I'm looking for an escort to a nearby system. This region is quite dangerous and our ship is not well-armed."</text>
<text name="text_QUEST_ESCORT_TEXT_2">There is a single ship at this beacon. They hail you, "We could really use some help. Our FTL navigation system is shot. Can you help us get to a nearby station where they can patch us up?"</text>
<text name="text_QUEST_ESCORT_TEXT_3">"Hello," your communicator opens a hail from a nearby ship. "Our weapon systems are malfunctioning and we're too afraid of pirates to travel home unassisted. Can you escort us?"</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_VS_FEDERATION_1">Upon arriving at this beacon, you detect a distress call. Local scans reveal that a Federation transport is under attack from a Rebel scout!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_VS_FEDERATION_2">You immediately notice a Rebel ship chasing what appears to be a civilian transport. However you are detecting chatter on an encrypted Federation channel... That transport is carrying Federation loyalists!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_VS_FEDERATION_3">Your sensors are picking up a distress call on an encrypted Federation channel. You eventually find a Federation scout being chased by a Rebel fighter!</text>
<text name="text_STORE_TEXT_1">A ship engineer has set up a small shop here.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_TEXT_2">You find yourself surrounded by a group of mysterious alien vessels. They hail you and apparently have some valuable technology for sale.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_TEXT_3">A transmission from the nearby planet indicates an outpost below which offers supplies to travelers. You send down an away party to check it out.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_TEXT_4">The space station here has a traveling merchant who shows you his wares.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_TEXT_5">There is only one other ship at this beacon, and it is showing heavy damage. You receive a message on your console: "Greetings, traveler. We were crippled by a band of pirates and are now forced to sell our remaining valuable equipment to acquire the necessary supplies to get home."</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_1">You arrive at a quiet spaceport and are immediately hailed by another ship at port with a "once in a lifetime deal!"</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_2">You jump into a sector filled with civilian activity. Your scan the various advertisement channels while waiting for your FTL to charge, and are intrigued by a grey-market shipwright.</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_3">Your ship is flooded with advertisement transmissions from nearby merchants as soon as you arrive at this beacon. You arbitrarily pick one to examine in detail.</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_4">Despite the barren area, a trader has set up shop at this beacon. He presents his offer.</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_5">The beacon at first glance seems home to a junk yard. Upon closer inspection, it reveals itself to be a ramshackle market. One trader has a deal that catches your eye.</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_CIV_6">A pawn broker has set up shop at this obscure beacon. He might be offering something worth looking at.</text>
<text name="text_TRAP_BEACON_TEXT_1">You arrive at the beacon and immediately detect a pirate ship. It seems this distress beacon was a trap!</text>
<text name="text_TRAP_BEACON_TEXT_2">"Haha! I knew someone would fall into our dastardly trap!" It appears this distress beacon was nothing but a decoy for a pirate ambush.</text>
<text name="text_TRAP_BEACON_TEXT_3">Your cockpit lights up with warning signals. You are being targeted by a nearby ship. The distress call was a lure to attract unwitting ships into weapons range. You prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="text_TRAP_BEACON_TEXT_4">As soon as you arrive at the distress signal, shots are fired toward your ship. A trap!</text>

<!-- data/events_boss.xml -->
<text name="event_BOSS_AUTOMATED_text">It appears this ship is also equipped with an advanced AI system. Now that the crew is dead, it has taken control!</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_DESTROYED_c1_text">Thanks for playing! Keep in mind this is still in beta and we have not created a satisfying conclusion to the game. Head to our forums to give us some feedback and let us know that you beat it. Thanks!</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_DESTROYED_text">Its explosion rocks your ship and you shudder with relief. You did it. The Federation is saved....</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_ESCAPED_text">Just as you finally gain the upper hand it finds a way to make an FTL jump. You've got to keep up the assault!</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_LIST_1_text">The people you rescued were primarily refugees fleeing the conflict. They offer you their sincere gratitude.</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_LIST_2_text">You are hailed, "Thank you! It's not much but we can repair a bit of damage before you jump off into the war. Good luck!"</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_LIST_3_text">The survivors send a message, "Thanks for the support, I don't know how much longer we could have held on. Take some supplies, we probably won't need them at this point."</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_c1_choice">Prepare to fight the Rebel ship!</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_c1_text">You move in to intercept.</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_c2_choice">There's no time, get ready to jump.</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_c2_text">You try to block out the horrors of war and focus on your mission.</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_TEXT_1_text">This is it... The Rebel flagship. If you are able to destroy this monstrosity, the Federation fleet will have a chance of surviving. There's no turning back!</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_TEXT_2_text">You chase down the flagship and discover it is heavily damaged from the previous fight. Scans indicate that it has redirected considerable power to its drones. Get ready for a fight.</text>
<text name="event_BOSS_TEXT_3_text">You're not certain how it's able to keep fighting with the amount of damage it has sustained. It looks like it's transferred power to the teleporter as well as... some kind of super weapon. Be prepared... this is it!</text>
<text name="event_FEDERATION_BASE_text">You arrive near the Federation Base to find the bulk of their fleet skirmishing with Rebel forces. You hang back near the far side of the moon to avoid the conflict. There's not much you can do to help in that battle, and your mission holds the key to turn the tide of the war. You prepare to face the Flagship.</text>
<text name="event_LAST_STAND_START_c1_c1_choice">Explain the weakness of the enemy fleet, the Rebel flagship.</text>
<text name="event_LAST_STAND_START_c1_c1_text">Tully responds, "It's settled. The Rebels will be here in a matter of moments. We will do what we can to hold off their warships but you must succeed in destroying this flagship. Your current outpost can provide some repairs and fuel, and the other repair stations can provide aid as well. Good luck."</text>
<text name="event_LAST_STAND_START_c1_choice">Explain your mission.</text>
<text name="event_LAST_STAND_START_c1_text">Your explanation is met with murmurs of cynicism and disbelief among the officers. General Turzil of the Engi Brigade speaks up, "Intel suggests potential counter to Rebel technology. Risk all or save none."</text>
<text name="event_LAST_STAND_START_text">You arrive at an outpost close to the Federation Base. Your access codes get you past initial security and an officer sets up a direct feed to the Federation Base's war room. Admiral Tully speaks first saying, "What is the meaning of this?! Who are you?"</text>
<text name="ship_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_deadCrew_text">There isn't time to salvage the enemy ship but your crew made off with a few nearby materials. Prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ship_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_destroyed_text">There's no time to salvage all of the wreck, the fleet is still nearby. Get ready to jump!</text>
<text name="ship_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_deadCrew_text">With the Rebel ship defeated you quickly salvage what you can and move to contact their prey.</text>
<text name="ship_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_destroyed_c1_choice">Contact the survivors.</text>
<text name="ship_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_destroyed_text">With the Rebel ship destroyed you are free to contact their would-be victim.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_1">Sensors indicate evidence of a huge battle nearby, but the immediate vicinity seems quiet. You try to lay low and keep out of the fighting.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_2">You arrive to find two fleets crashing against each other. Sensors are tracking the extent of the carnage. You quietly wait for the FTL drive to charge, knowing that the only way you can help is by completing your mission.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_3">A battle rages in the distance. Sensors suggest the presence of many vulnerable escape pods, but you know you cannot stop to help. The mission is paramount.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_4">A battle rages on in the distance. As much as you would like to help in the fight, you know the importance of your mission.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_5">You don't need advanced Sensors to tell there is a battle going on. You look out of the window quietly, waiting to jump. There's no way you can help in this fight.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_6">Two fleets are volleying shots at each other. Luckily, no one seems interested in your ship. You prepare to make another jump.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_1">You arrive in the middle of a raging battle. Both sides are taking heavy losses. A small squadron flies past and a fighter breaks off, moving toward your position.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_2">Two fleets fight nearby. You try to skirt around the edges of the battle and keep out of weapons range, but a Rebel scout spots you and moves in.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_3">It's hard to tell who is winning the nearby battle. Before you have a chance to figure it out, a fighter moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_4">The sheer scale of the destruction in the distance is almost breath-taking. Unfortunately, your position as an independent observer doesn't last for long!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_5">The destruction in the distance is almost awe-inspiring. However you're dragged back to reality as Sensors indicate you are under attack.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_BOTH_FIGHT_6">You don't have any time to worry about the battle in the distance. The fight is coming to you really quickly!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_FED_1">You arrive to see a number of Federation forward-carriers and dreadnoughts. This must be a system of high importance to warrant such a fleet.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_FED_2">There are a few Federation fleets in the nearby area as well as a lot of wreckage. There must have been minor skirmishes in the area.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_FED_3">A few scattered heavy vessels are left to defend the nearby Federation settlement. They seem to be in the process of evacuation.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_FED_4">A large host of Federation heavy vessels are in formation around the beacon. Sensors run hot with missile locks, but once you transmit your ship signature they leave you alone.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_FED_5">A battalion of Federation fighters are fighting around a nearby moon with their carriers waiting in the distance. They must have encountered a Rebel scout squadron.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_1">Although you were expecting the Rebels, you never imagined their fleet could have grown so fast. You scanners can hardly register them all before a fighter stationed nearby moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_2">This system is flooded with Rebel warships. Luckily your ship's signature is disguised as a civilian transport. Most heavy vessels ignore you but a small fighter is approaching with weapons hot!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_3">You arrive to find a Rebel battalion encircling a nearby planet, launching landing parties. A small scout moves toward your position. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_4">As soon as you arrive you find yourself in the debris of a fierce battle. However, only Rebel warships remain and you find yourself immediately under attack.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_5">Shots fly by and your computer registers multiple weapon locks as soon as you arrive. Evasive action!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_6">What was once a great series of space stations is now nothing but a small ring of debris around the nearby moon. There's no time to mourn the dead; an enemy approaches!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_FLEETS_REBEL_7">The Federation seems to have put up a good fight. A number of Rebel ships lie broken or wounded. However their overwhelming numbers force the remaining Federation forces to retreat. Hopefully you can get away in time as well.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_1">There is a a mobile ship construction platform stationed at this beacon. After a brief exchange they give you clearance to receive emergency repairs and military supplies.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_2">An Engi civilian ship-yard has been converted into a military refueling station. They offer you the chance to patch up your ship and refresh some supplies.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_3">Chatter on the comm suggests the nearby Federation base is outfitted with a repair station. When you forward your mission priority they quickly help repair your ship and give you some supplies.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_4">A forward construction station is in the process of repairing damaged warships. Your command codes convince them to do a quick patch job on your ship.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_5">A trade station was abandoned nearby. Some Federation engineers repurposed their shipyard to perform military repairs. They offer to help fix your ship.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_1">Although this sector is still under Federation control, a small scout has slipped by the fleet. You move in to engage.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_2">Long range scanners show this system is empty of any capital ships. Clearly it is not of strategic value. Wait... FTL signatures show a Rebel scout just jumped nearby!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_3">Sensors indicate that the Rebels are setting up a forward Jump Beacon behind the nearby planet's moon. More importantly, a number of ships are passing by; prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_4">Federation ships are scarce in this region of space despite a number of civilian space stations. You see a small bomber squadron engaged with some Federation scouts and quickly move in to assist.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_5">As soon as you arrive at the beacon, a Rebel scout turns to engage. Power up the weapons!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_6">You scan the area, finding signatures for only a small trade vessel. However, as it approaches you see the silhouette of a Rebel scout! You run the scanners again and discover their registration is fake. You move in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_1">Shots fly by your port windows followed by a Rebel scout in pursuit of a damaged cruiser. Should we move in to engage?</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_2">There seems to be a small Federation colony under attack by a Rebel forward scout. Will you protect them?</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_3">A number of large transports are being pursued by a Rebel bombing squadron. One bomber has managed to slip through the defensive fire, and is poised to wreak havoc among the enormous yet vulnerable transports. There's time for you to advance and take it out!</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_4">A battle rages nearby between small fighters; apparently fighting over a space station. The Federation appears to be losing ships fast. Shall we assist them?</text>
<text name="text_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_5">A civilian ship is broadcasting a request for assistance on a secure Federation channel. They are being harassed by Rebel scouts. Will you respond?</text>

<!-- data/events_crystal.xml -->
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_AUTO_text">The Rebels must have sent their automated scouts to find you. One jumps in and immediately moves to attack.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_BREAK_1_text">You fire everything you have, but the crystal barrier remains strong. After a time you give up and move on.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_BREAK_3_c1_choice">Investigate the cache.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_BREAK_3_text">Against all odds, a lucky shot strikes an existing fracture in the crystal, compounding it into a crack that grows until an entire section of the barrier falls away!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_1_text">On arriving at the base of the crater, your team discovers a long-forgotten weapons cache. Most of the equipment is out of action, but not all of it!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_2_text">Your away team is greeted at the crater by the owners of the cache, who are none too happy. You grab what you can and run back to the ship, but not before they teleport aboard!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c1_c0_clone">Luckily, your clone bay is able to revive your crewmember.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c1_choice">Pull out now!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c1_text">You push the impulse engines to their limit and are able to break out of the gravity well. Your crewmember, along with the stockpile, is reduced to the size of a tennis ball - but you're left in one piece.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c2_choice">Detonate your entire fuel reserves to escape with your crew and the cargo.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c2_text">You swoop into the heart of the distortion and pick up your crewmember and the cargo. You then eject your FTL fuel and ignite it, sending a shock wave that thrusts your ship well beyond the event horizon of the singularity. That was close.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c3_choice">(Improved Teleporter) Beam your crewmember back on board.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c3_text">You floor the engines to escape the gravity well while trying to get a teleporter lock on your crewmember despite the massive interference. You're barely able to get them back on board before the entire area is consumed into the singularity.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c4_choice">(Advanced Engines) Rescue your crewmember and the cargo.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_c4_text">You swoop into the heart of the distortion and pick up your crewmember and the cargo. Your top of the line impulse engines are barely able to get your ship out of the gravity well before the whole ship is consumed. That was close.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_LIST_3_text">You send a crewmember down to check out the cache. The comm goes dead, and shortly thereafter massive gravity readings are detected on the asteroid. You must have triggered some kind of singularity booby trap! We've got to leave now before we're pulled in!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c1_choice">Attempt to break through with the weapons you have.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c2_c1_choice">Investigate the cache.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c2_choice">(Breach Missiles) Use a Breach Missile.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c2_text">Your Breach warheads dislodge and shatter a massive shard of crystal, leaving your away team enough space to climb down and take a look.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c3_choice">(Crystal crewmember) Have your Crystalline Being recalibrate your weapons.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_c3_text">Your Crystalline crew-member is able to adjust the detonation frequency of your weapons to resonate with this type of crystal, and the barrier gives little resistance.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CACHE_text">Odd radar pings from a huge, orbiting asteroid here reveal a Crystalline cache of some kind. A deep crater has been sealed over with a thick layer of crystal to keep whatever's inside safe - it'd take some serious firepower to break though.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_1_text">You speak at length about nothing particularly interesting. "Wow, thanks. Oh look, another alien ship! I wonder if they're as nice as you." Seeing the Rebel decals you doubt they're friendly. They spot you and move in to attack, while the Crystalline civilian jumps away.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_2_text">You speak at length about nothing particularly interesting. "Wow, thanks! I don't know if this is of any use to you, but we have some supplies we can offer you. Perhaps you can use them on your trip!"</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_3_text">You speak at length about nothing particularly interesting. "Wow, thanks! Perhaps we can fix up a bit of your hull for sating my curiosity. We're pretty handy with repairs."</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c1_c1_choice">Try to answer his questions.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c1_c2_choice">"I don't have time for this."</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c1_c2_text">"I see. Oh well. Maybe the next alien I meet will be nicer..." You prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c1_choice">Yes.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c1_text">"What do you eat? What is your culture like? How long do your people live?"</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c2_choice">No.</text>

<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_c3_text">"Wow, you're one of us! I didn't know we made an alliance with the aliens. I guess I won't bother you, but here, have some of our extra supplies!"</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_text">A small civilian vessel messages you, "Wow! You're that alien that opened up the portal, aren't you! Are you busy? Can I ask you a question?"</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_text">A large convoy of lumbering civilian ships appears to be passing through this region. You show no hostile intentions, but they are taking no chances, immediately sending their escort to attack!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c1_choice">Offer supplies.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c1_text">You send over some supplies to help them on their way and in return they upload their flight plan to your computer, allowing you to map the sector! "The Federation fleet's still standing - get there while you can!"</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c2_choice">Attack the traitors.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c2_text">Deserters cannot be tolerated. You open fire on the cowards - though it doesn't please you to do so. The Federation needs every soldier it can get.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c3_choice">Leave them be.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c3_text">You send them a friendly warning regarding the armada of Rebel ships pursuing you, and then get underway lest they catch you up.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_text">For a moment you assume it's a glitch, but no... you've found a Federation military ship! They hail you and, after some probing, reveal that they deserted the Federation fleet before stumbling into this sector while seeking refuge.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_LIST_1_text">"Thank you! We heard you jumped into an unknown sector and we figured it would be a safe enough place to hide from the Rebels. We were wrong!" They transfer some excess materials for your trouble.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_LIST_2_text">The ship looks battered and ready to break apart. You quickly move in to help rescue the survivors, but it looks like only one person made it. They offer to join your crew as thanks.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_c1_choice">Save the Federation ship.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_c1_text">It doesn't look like the Fed ship can stand much more pressure. You fly in and intercept the Crystalline ship.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_c2_choice">Prepare to leave.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_c2_text">With the Federation ship distracting the guard, you are free to continue on your mission.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_FED_text">There appears to be a fight going on nearby. A Crystalline border guard is chasing a small Federation ship!</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c1_choice">Leave your crewmember behind.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c1_text">You're committed to both saving the Federation and upholding the principles it worked to maintain. Your crewmember will remain and make good on the promise - you still have a galaxy to save. They give you some supplies for your trouble.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c2_choice">Pull your guy out.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c2_text">The Crystalline captain contacts you urgently: "What is the meaning of this?! Had you no wish to aid us you might simply have declined, but THIS... is an insult!" His turns his massive ship on yours and you prepare to fight for your life.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c3_c3_text">Another cycle passes while the Rebel fleet draws ever nearer. You contact the captain again. "Alien Captain, your knowledge of our customs has most impressed us. Your crewmember is on their way back to you now, along with a token of our respect."</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c3_choice">Wait.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_c3_text">You've made a commitment, and that still means something. You wait one jump cycle and then inquire with the Crystalline captain about the status of the operation. "We respect your strength. The operation will take one more cycle."</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_choice">Send a crewmember to help.</text>
<text name="event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_text">You do as you're asked and send a crewmember down to the planet to assist. They discover a massive Crystal excavation operation and it quickly becomes clear this is a task that will take days, not hours.</text>

<text name="text_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_1">You detect a heavily armed Crystalline ship escorting some sort of prison vessel. Scans indicate there are a number of non-Crystal based life forms aboard; they must be rounding up all of the intruders in their space! Before you can react, you hear the telltale sounds of a teleporter going off.</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_2">You arrive near a small settlement and a lone guard ship moves to intercept you. You try to contact them but they are refusing all hails. Suddenly you hear lasers ricocheting from within the ship. You've been boarded!</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_3">You pick up chatter from a nearby ship, "Yes... Here are some interesting specimens. Try to take them alive this time, there's a lot of money to be had on aliens." Scanners indicate a remote teleporter was just used.</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_1">You arrive near a fleet of crystal ships, civilian or mercantile from the looks of them. You pause to scan one but they react immediately and send an escort to fight you off. Prepare to engage!</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_2">You arrive at the Beacon and are immediately greeted by an automatic message or warning of some kind. The translator can't seem to discern its purpose but after a few short moments an alarm goes off and a hostile ship jumps in!</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_3">You receive a message, "Hah. It looks like another worthless alien-filled craft. Prepare to meet your maker!" Weapon locks detected.</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_4">A Crystalline ship messages you, "I've heard tales that our isolation has finally ended. As a warrior I must demand to test my skills against you!" Before you can respond they move in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_5">You arrive in a busy sector. At first no one pays any mind to your alien ship but soon you're registering a number of scan signatures. You get the feeling you're not wanted here just seconds before registering enemy weapon locks!</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_6">You jump next to a node busy with traffic, but before long all nearby ships notice you and keep their distance, uncertain of your allegiance. After an awkward standoff, a military ship breaks away from the rest and charges you.</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_7">A barrage of rasps and clicks is broadcast over the comm; the universal translator understands little, but the words 'aliens', 'allowed' and 'no' come through quite clearly. You'll have to prove your right to be here in combat!</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_SHIP_SURRENDER_1">"We yield, aliens. We have no wish to die fighting you."</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_SHIP_SURRENDER_2">"You have bested us! I will no longer underestimate you Outsiders. Please, let us leave in peace."</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_SHIP_SURRENDER_3">They appear to be transmitting the universal signals for surrender. Will you let them go?</text>
<text name="text_CRYSTAL_SHIP_SURRENDER_4">They message you, "I see now there was a misunderstanding and there is no need for more bloodshed. Will you forgive our lack of discretion?"</text>

<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_1">As soon as you arrive, all of the ships docked at a nearby station scatter and jump while the station itself uses some form of cloak technology to disappear. They mustn't like outsiders here...</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_2">No ships are in range, so you take the time to scan the area. It seems like every planet you've seen so far shows signs of highly developed habitation without overpopulation. They must have a very structured and well regulated society.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_3">There appears to be no one living near this node, a rare sight in this highly developed sector.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_4">You arrive near a civilian settlement. It looks like their homes, ships and stations all rely heavily on an intriguing crystalline material. You wonder how they are able to create so much of this substance, as yet undiscovered in the rest of the galaxy.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_5">A few merchant ships pass nearby but they are either ignoring your hails or their computer isn't designed to work through the same frequencies...</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_6">A number of civilian ships seem to be evacuating a small colony. One ship messages you before jumping away, "Damn you aliens! This is why we closed that Long-range Beacon in the first place!"</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_7">As soon as you arrive, all of the ships docked at a nearby station scatter and jump away, while the station itself uses some form of cloak technology to disappear. They mustn't like outsiders here...</text>

<text name="text_STORE_CRYSTAL_2">"Ah! Hello aliens", says a rotund crystalline being on the vid screen. "I hoped I would run into one of you. I am a collector of alien artifacts and hoped you would have some equipment to barter!"</text>
<text name="text_STORE_CRYSTAL_3">You arrive at a trade depot and find a store that is willing to open communications with you. "I can't say I've traded with your kind before, but perhaps we could work out some sort of exchange."</text>
<text name="text_STORE_CRYSTAL_4">You receive an incoming transmission, but it seems badly garbled. Eventually you realize it's advertising an equipment store. "Apologies," says the vendor, when you finally get him on the vid screen, "Long time since use universal translator no necessary. Please, buy, buy!"</text>

<text name="event_ENGI_SEX_c3_c1_text">You elect to leave the two Engi ships... to their "business." After questioning your Engi crewmember, however, you do manage to salvage what scrap parts you can from the perimeter, even though you feel slightly dirty for doing so.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SEX_c3_choice">(Engi Crew) Have your Engi crewmember hail the vessel and assess the damage.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SEX_c3_text">Your Engi crewmember refuses. In a halting use of adjectives and nouns, followed by some animated holographic aids, the Engi explains the ships are... using each other to, loosely translated, "achieve a union." For some reason, this consolidation of ship matter sounds embarrassing and personal.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SEX_text">What appeared to be a single damaged ship is in fact two ships that have smashed into each other... there is a flurry of comm signals and damage, and it's hard to determine what occurred. The vessels appear to be... Engi? They look locked together by the impact and can't free themselves.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_STATION_DISTRESS_LIST_1_text">You receive another message from the ship, this time with a Mantis at the comm-log. "Foolish meatsacks," he yells. Sensors indicate the ship is moving in to attack and boarders teleport from the station.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_STATION_DISTRESS_LIST_2_text">You approach to find a Mantis ship assaulting a small Engi space station. You prepare for a fight!</text>

<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_LIST_1_text">The Engi seem relieved, and eager to get underway. They set off without saying goodbye.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_LIST_2_text">The Engi are satisfied with your explanation. "Beneficial. Subject goal: long, long journey. Remains compatible with transfer of goods from Engi." They send over the gear willingly, and you feel better for it.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_c1_choice">Explain that you're friendly.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_c2_choice">Accept their offer of surrender.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_c2_text">The Engi obediently transfer over the goods and get on their way. Money for nothing.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_SURRENDER_text">An Engi ship in the vicinity, seeing you jump in armed to the teeth, immediately broadcasts its surrender: "Subject goal: wealth. Engi motivation: survival. Transfer of goods acceptable?"</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c1_choice">Message them and ask if you can help.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c1_text">Slightly shocked at your question, their leader quickly responds, "Declined offer with apologetic gratitude. Topic of discussion private matter, no concern of Federation."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c2_choice">Ignore it and move on.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c2_text">You can't help but wonder what they were discussing as you prepare to jump.</text>

<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c3_c1_text">"Secret technologies stolen by Mantis. Implicit connection to Rebels. Implicit. Tracked Mantis to hidden Rebel base, uploading coordinates."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c3_choice">(Engi Crew) Have your Engi crewmember contact them.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_c3_text">Your crewmember syncs with the comm unit to communicate with them directly. You offer your help and a summary of the ship's mission. They respond, "Our goals have analogous elements. However, not all available for disclosure, discretion necessary."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_1_text">You arrive near a small fleet of civilian Engi ships. A simple decryption and translation of their comm frequency tells you that they are having a frantic discussion about something obviously troubling them.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2FAKE_SURRENDER_c1_c1_choice">Let them go.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2FAKE_SURRENDER_c1_c2_choice">Ignore him and attack.</text>

<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2FAKE_SURRENDER_c1_text">"Ah, so that's what you're after. Too bad, you followed the wrong ship. The envoy that passed through here was a fake, to trick fools like you. Now let us go!"</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2FAKE_SURRENDER_text">"Stop! I don't want to die here."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2FAKE_text">You arrive at one of the Rebel bases that the Engi told you about. It appears abandoned except for one scout ship. Perhaps you could extract information from them.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_SURRENDER_c1_c1_choice">Let them go.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_SURRENDER_c1_c1_text">You prepare an FTL message containing the coordinates to send to the Engi and get ready to jump.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_SURRENDER_c1_choice">Demand information on the stolen technology.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_SURRENDER_c1_text">"Of course, that's why you're here. Yes, they passed by here but I had nothing to do with it, I don't know what they were carrying. I'll transmit coordinates. Now just let us go..."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_SURRENDER_text">"Stop! This isn't worth dying for..."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_2REAL_text">You arrive at one of the Rebel bases that the Engi told you about. It appears abandoned except for one scout ship. Perhaps you could extract information from them.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_3_text">You have finally caught up with the ships you've been hunting. A hangar-sized cargo ship is being escorted by a number of Mantis ships. As you reconsider the assault, a squadron of Engi ships with pirate emblems jump in and assist you. You prepare to fight the Mantis but scans indicate they are manned by Rebels!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_4_c1_c1_choice">Transmit coordinates of Federation command.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_4_c1_c1_text">"Satisfactory. Delivery of tech will assist in Federation cause. Gratitude alone insufficient. Commencing ship repair and compensation." Their crews deliver an advanced augmentation for installation but you're more pleased to hear that the Federation will have an improved arsenal.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_4_c1_choice">Ask about the Mantis ships.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_4_c1_text">"Likely ploy by Rebels to avoid breaking non-aggression pact with Engi. 97.56 percent likely. Your mission to assist last Federation fleet, correct? Coordinates?"</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_UNLOCK_4_text">The Engi emerge victorious from their battles with only minor losses. They message you, "Project X-ME56 commissioned by Federation military research division. Advanced stealth cruiser. Project finished during rebellion. Unable to reconnect with Federation military command."</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_REBORN_text">To your surprise your Engi crewmember reforms. It looks as if the virus reconstituted, repurposed, and reprogrammed the Engi host and wants to travel with you... and it seems to have learned a great deal from its time on your ship.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c1_choice">Hold on! Let us try to purge the system code!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c1_text">Wiping your engine core and shields proves useless... eventually you trap the virus in the weapons systems to purge it, but before you do, the Engi grow restless and attack!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c2_choice">Attack the Engi vessel!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c2_text">The Engi be damned, no one threatens your ship. You prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c3_c1_text">The Engi thank you for deleting the virus, and jump away. They offer a unique ship augmentation as a reward.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c3_choice">(Hacking System) Isolate and quarantine the virus.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c3_text">It takes some time, and the virus is slippery, but you eventually confine it to a useless sub-system prison where it frantically begins calculating insults at you. You eject the system from the ship and then silence the little binary criminal with your weapons.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c4_c1_text">After a few minutes, the virus "sees the light" and integrates itself in a positive manner with the computer society on your ship, repairing your hull and attempting to optimize your reactor.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c4_choice">(Improved Hacking) Reprogram the virus.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c4_text">You proceed to interface with the virus and optimize its repair and benevolence routines.</text>

<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c6_choice">(Lanius Crew) Your Lanius crewmember gestures frantically.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c6_text">Oddly enough, the Lanius seems aware of which computer the virus is present in, and proceeds to... digest the terminal. There is a burst of O2, and the Engi ship powers down its weapons, no longer sensing the virus on board. The Engi send some parts over to repair your damaged computer, along with a unique ship augmentation as a reward for terminating the virus.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c7_c0_clone">The virus appears to have disrupted your clone bay's capability to revive the lost crewmember!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c7_choice">(Engi Crew) Have your Engi crewmember negotiate with the Engi ship.</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_c7_text">As the Engi attempts to contact the vessel and negotiate, your Engi crewmember suddenly dissolves into nanites - the virus has murdered again! Detecting activity on board your ship, the Engi vessel opens fire!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_c1_text">They insist they must destroy your ship to prevent the virus from escaping!</text>
<text name="event_ENGI_VIRUS_text">The Engi are awaiting you at the beacon, with their weapons on-line! They explain a computer virus that is wanted for hostile acts against the Engi (multiple counts of binary scrambling, nano-dissolution, and variable interference) is aboard your vessel.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_1_text">The Engi station is stripped bare and there are signs of a fierce battle. The Mantis must have left the distress call active to lure other ships into a trap.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_2_text">The station was in the process of being evacuated. A number of civilian Engi offer their gratitude as they finalize their preparations to leave. They offer some fuel as a reward.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_3_c1_choice">Request fuel.</text>

<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_3_c4_text">They respond, "Understood. Re-establishment of Federation highest import. Transmitting hidden base coordinates. Repairing hull and attaching ship to ship ordnance."</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_3_text">The station hails you, "Gratitude. Expected probability of defeat without assistance... 86.2 percent. Request suitable reward."</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_ENGI_STATION_4_text">They thank you for the assistance and when you tell them of your mission, one of the Engi asks if he can assist your crew. You welcome him aboard.</text>

<text name="ship_ENGI_VIRUS_SHIP_ALT_destroyed_text">With the ship destroyed, you scrap it and prepare to jump away.</text>
<text name="ship_ENGI_VIRUS_SHIP_deadCrew_text">With the Engi crew dead, you detect that the virus has abandoned your ship and disappeared somewhere within the systems of Engi vessel. It will likely infect whatever Engi ship passes next, but your mission is too vital to risk re-infection by stopping it.</text>
<text name="ship_ENGI_VIRUS_SHIP_destroyed_text">With the ship destroyed, you detect that the virus has abandoned your ship and disappeared somewhere within the systems of the wreckage. It will likely infect whatever Engi ship passes next, but your mission is too vital to risk re-infection by stopping it.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_GIFT_1">An Engi vessel hails you. "Identity: Federation? Outlier probability. Implies... revival. Implies... hope. Assistance suggested." They offer some supplies.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_GIFT_2">You cross paths with an Engi cargo vessel hurrying home before the Mantis fleets attempt to take over this sector. They're happy to offload some of their cargo to get home faster.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_GIFT_3">You make contact with an isolated Engi science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Mantis invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_GIFT_4">This was the site of a recent battle. Either a show of Mantis force, or the Engi here weren't disposed to go peacefully. You pick through the pieces.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_MANTIS_FIGHT_1">A mixed radar signal turns out to be a Mantis attack ship scavenging the remains of an Engi carrier. They turn and fight.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_MANTIS_FIGHT_2">You come across a Mantis raider taking pot shots at a defenceless Engi supply station. Discovering its weapons aren't much of a match for the station's armour, it turns on your ship. Battle stations!</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_MANTIS_FIGHT_3">The area looks clear, and you prepare to jump off, but a Mantis scout jumps in behind you! They're as surprised as you are, but their weapons are already online.</text>
<text name="text_ENGI_MANTIS_FIGHT_4">You find a Mantis ship harrying a small squad of Engi. They make it to the node and jump off, leaving you toe to toe with their pursuer!</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_1">The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Engi were here not too long ago; but no longer.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_10">A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here. You have other places to be.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_2">You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. It would be of little interest to the Engi nearby.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_3">You have arrived near an Engi construction yard. Most Engi maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships. Truly a sight to behold.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_4">Even though each "individual" Engi is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions. A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Engi travellers.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_5">You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_6">This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_7">There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Mantis invasion. No doubt interested in buying the efficient technology of the Engi.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_8">You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ENGI_9">The Engi seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ENGI_1">You have arrived in Engi space. The Mantis have been threatening the Engi core worlds, but you should be able to stock up for your journey.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ENGI_2">You have arrived in Engi space. The fall of the Federation has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ENGI_1">The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ENGI_2">A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realize it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ENGI_3">An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>

<text name="event_FUEL_APPROACH_DECLINE_LIST_1_text">"I assure you that we mean no harm. See, we'll send some fuel over on a transport." A small ship docks and offloads some fuel just as they said. They leave, saying, "Stay cautious, friend."</text>
<text name="event_FUEL_APPROACH_DECLINE_LIST_2_text">"No one trusts anyone these days..." The ship jumps away.</text>
<text name="event_FUEL_APPROACH_DECLINE_LIST_3_text">They reply,"Keep our distance? Let's see if you can stop us!" They power up their weapons and advance.</text>
<text name="event_FUEL_APPROACH_SCAN_LIST_1_text">Sensors indicate their ship is without military-grade weaponry, even small arms. You allow them to dock and they give you some fuel saying, "I remember a time when we didn't have to be so paranoid about each others' intentions... Stay safe."</text>

<text name="event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_c1_choice">(Mantis crewmember) Attempt to hail him.</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_c1_text">Your Mantis crew-member steps forward. He and KazaaakplethKilik perform a weird kind of alien haka. You, meanwhile, charge the battle systems.</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_c2_choice">Prepare to fight.</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_text">You cross paths with a Mantis ship that looks to have had dozens of layers of armor-plating added over what must have been a hundred year career. Its captain is legendary thief KazaaakplethKilik. Your crew look frightened.</text>
<text name="event_MANTIS_SUN_FIGHT_text">Who knows why the Mantis would venture so close to a sun. Perhaps it makes for more of a challenge?</text>
<text name="event_START_BEACON_MANTIS_text">You've entered a poorly charted area of space that's known to be home to the Mantis. Ensure your hull plating is up to scratch and that you have enough fuel in the tank to make it through.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_BOARDERS_1">A derelict and still smoking Mantis vessel floats by. The battle must have been recent; its surviving crew beam aboard. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_BOARDERS_2">Your world, all of a sudden, changes. The Mantis are on board your ship.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_BOARDERS_3">You hear a grating rattle and a soft clicking. You reach for your pistol.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_1">A Mantis vessel flashes past your view-screen, weapons and engines at full. A tiny blip on the sensor readout marks its quarry.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_2">You spot a Mantis ship hunting in the distance.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_3">A Mantis ship engaging a civilian hails you. Sparks fly about his cockpit as he yells, "Stay out of this human! Else you are next!"</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_4">Local sensors pick up two ships engaged in a heated battle. It seems the Mantis military ship will surely defeat its prey.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_5">You pick up a distress call from a civilian ship. It's being chased by a Mantis ship!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_AVOID_1">Smoking, the civilian ship limps on. You set your sights on the future.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_AVOID_2">The noise of the FTL spinning up almost drowns out the explosions. Almost.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_CIVILIAN_AVOID_3">You let them pass and try not to think about it.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_1">A Mantis military ship appears on local radar alongside the remains of a human freighter. Prepare for a hostile encounter!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_10">The Mantis ship is pleased to see you, and fires up its weapon systems.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_11">You recognize the outline of a Mantis ship against the blackness. Engage!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_12">Something red looms. It's the Mantis.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_13">A Mantis vessel hails you. "This hail is merely a distraction!" You notice their shields and weapons have come online.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_14">You notice a flurry of laser fire glance by the port window. The Mantis are upon you.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_15">The Mantis hail you. Their captain says, "I claim this vessel for my clan. Good hunting!"</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_16">A Mantis female comes on the vidscreen. The females don't make it to authority unless they're particularly vicious. You power the weapons.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_17">A Mantis ship with the markings of a warrior tribe breaks position and attacks!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_18">A Mantis ship hails: "Ah! Fine prey. Fine prey! We honor you with our most eviscerating arsenal!" You sense a cloud to this silver lining and power the weapons.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_19">Children on Earth are told terrible tales of the blood red Mantis invasion ships - much like the one bearing down on you now - which once threatened the planet. You order weapons free!</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_2">A Mantis military scout hails your ship. "Foolish alien! Your kind has stifled our greatness for too long! You will rue the day you backed the Federation!"</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_20">A youthful-looking Mantis captain hails. "You, prey, must know. Your death, Kaaazthwak's final kill before maturity. Kaaazthwak pay respects." Seems respects in Mantis culture are paid with lasers.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_3">A small Mantis cruiser is broadcasting a repeating message on a wide-band frequency, "All non-Mantis ships that enter our territory are forfeit. Lower your shields and surrender if you value your lives."</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_4">You detect a small military outpost and a few freighters nearby. This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation. As you consider your options, a ship launches from the outpost. Prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_5">You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony. They certainly waste no time expanding their claims. A Mantis ship moves to intercept you before you can jump away.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_6">A Mantis military scout seems to have just finished a salvage op on a nearby wreck. They have no time to waste with warnings and appear to wish to fight.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_7">A small military craft hails you and a Mantis captain appears on your receiver. "All local human colonies have been punished for the Federation's transgressions. Submit to processing."</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_8">A nearby Mantis ship begins aggressive maneuvers. You prepare for the worst.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_9">A stream of clicks and gurgling comes on the comm from a hostile Mantis scout. The universal translator might be on the blink, but his intent is obvious.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_1">You're greeted by a rare sight: a Mantis ship that appears not to have noticed you.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_2">For once, you see the Mantis before they see you.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_3">When they see the Mantis warship waiting in ambush at your intended coordinates, your crew is relieved to note you've jumped someway off the mark.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_4">You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "Negative, I have killed more humans!" You gulp noticeably, but luckily they don't see you yet.</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_5">You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "The one on the right is starting to rot. Take him down. Take off his fingers. Put him out of the airlock." They certainly don't seem to be friendly...</text>
<text name="text_MANTIS_FIGHT_CHOICE_6">You overhear Mantis comm chatter: "Agreed. Next ship is your turn. Good hunting." They don't see you yet.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_1">At this point you almost expect a fight with the Mantis, but this beacon appears to be entirely devoid of other ships. You take the time to catch your breath and double check the ship's systems.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_2">The only thing this beacon offers is a view of deep space and a brief respite from battles. For some this must be a welcome refuge.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_3">A nearby Mantis mining operation is clearly using heavy Engi slave labor. You briefly consider the possibility of emancipating the slaves, but the Mantis presence is too formidable. You decide to lay low.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_4">There aren't so many parts of Mantis space that aren't dotted by the wrecks of battles past, but this is one of them. You take a deep breath and prepare to move on.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_5">There's nothing here but space debris and some uninhabitable planetoids.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_MANTIS_6">You fancy you see something moving in the shadow of the beacon, but all remains still.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_1">Upon arriving at the beacon, you're hailed by a well-spoken Mantis, "Hail, traveler. These are dangerous times. Perhaps you find yourself in need of our services?" He appears to be a trader.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_2">Uncertain about what you'll discover at this beacon, you scan the surroundings. You detect several warnings on wide-band channels discouraging any violence in protected trade-space. Perhaps you can find some wares nearby.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_3">Merchants are not highly respected among the Mantis race, so few undertake the profession. You're mildly surprised to receive an advertisement from a nearby space dock. You decide to see what they have to offer.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_4">Identifying a Mantis trading post ahead, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. The leader hails you: "You have scrap? Quickly, come dock before the warriors see you."</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_5">A struggling Mantis cargo ship headed for the node raises what's left of shields as you jump in. You power up your weapons as a show of force, and they reluctantly agree to offload some of their cargo to you - for a price.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_MANTIS_6">The Rebels are already here! The crew braces for impact, but none comes. The sensors report the unmanned rebel supply ship is malfunctioning and is stuck in vending mode - for a little scrap you can take your pick.</text>

<text name="event_NEBULA_LOST_SHIP_LIST2_1_text">Your local radar flickers, periodically showing signs of a large object in the clouds nearby. However it's enough to get coordinates and you find the ship... an empty hull, long since stripped of functioning components.</text>

<text name="text_NEBULA_AUTO_LIST_5">It's worrying that the Rebels have penetrated so deep into uncharted space, even if it is only an unmanned craft. It arms its weapons; you should do the same.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_BOARDING_TEXT_1">You see a small station nearby and feel the shudder of shots ringing through the ship. You can't be sure without sensors, but it seems there may be intruders on the ship!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_BOARDING_TEXT_2">You arrive in the nebula and immediately receive a message from an unknown source, "Prepare to be boarded!" With the static from the nebula, there's no way to tell where they came from, but you hear shots fired on board the ship.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_BOARDING_TEXT_3">You see a number of derelict ships near this beacon. After a short time you hear the tell-tale sounds of a teleporter and shouts coming from within the ship. You've been boarded!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_1">You can't see anything through the thick gases surrounding your ship. Without knowing what is out there, all you can do is wait for your FTL to charge.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_2">Without active sensors you have no other option but to look out of the view-ports in apprehension. It's eerily quiet.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_3">As you wait for the FTL drive to charge, you half expect to be ambushed at any moment. However, no attack comes...</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_4">You feel naked without functioning sensors. You half expect a Rebel ship to appear from behind a cloud at any moment, but none come.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_5">Your crew are constantly looking out of the windows, checking for hostiles. They jump at every creak and moan of the ship. The tension is almost palpable...</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_6">You nervously glance out the windows but the only thing to greet you is more clouds and silence.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_7">You cycle through wide-band comm channels as soon as you arrive. Nothing but static.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_8">With the sensors down, you spend a good deal of time staring out the window. It is, you must admit, rather beautiful here.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_9">There's nothing here, save for vast swirls of gas reflecting rays from a distant sun.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT_1">Nebulas are known to be popular Mantis hunting grounds. Information you would have done well to heed here.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT_2">You detect a Mantis expedition vessel returning home with its haul. So determined are they, in fact, that they don't wait to see if you're hostile before firing.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT_3">A Mantis ship, lost in the storm, hails you. "Sensors are out. We have no local telemetry. We will take yours." You detect a power increase in their weapons systems.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT_4">A Mantis ship hails you through the storm: "These are sacred Urggghtnag clan hunting grounds. You are prey." Shields up!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT_5">You notice a Mantis attack ship ducking between the clouds of swirling space stuff; it's hunting you. You try to get the jump and move in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_PIRATE_1">As you drift through the nebula an unmarked vessel descends from the clouds and into your wake. Their weapons come online.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_PIRATE_2">A pirate ship pulls out of the ether and hails: "You know what I love about this part of the galaxy? The explorers! You always carry such fine loot." They lock weapons.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_PIRATE_3">As you coast through the nebula a pirate ship matches your course and closes the distance. Better to pick your battleground, but beggars can't be choosers.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_PIRATE_4">A hostile vessel descends from out of the nebula. Combat stations!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_PIRATE_5">You try to read the ID of a ship ahead in the fog, but it's too thick to penetrate. You have your answer when the ship turns, weapons hot!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_1">You cross paths with an advance scout of the Rebel fleet searching this section of the nebula for your ship.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_2">A ship bearing Rebel colors can be seen waiting near the beacon. They must have been waiting for you, since they engage immediately.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_3">The Rebels must have anticipated you would try to lose them within the nebula. A scout is waiting for you at the beacon.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_4">It looks like you will be unable to avoid the Rebels by traveling through the nebula. A Rebel ship is waiting for you near the beacon.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_5">Shortly after you arrive, a Rebel ship jumps nearby. There looks to be no escape. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_6">Newton-knows what brings this Rebel ship so far out; its captain hails, but does a double take when he identifies your ship. They open fire.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_REBEL_LIST_7">A Rebel ship hails, but you don't take chances in conditions like this. You block the frequency and prepare to engage.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_1">Some brave entrepreneurs set up a station here to extract elements from the nebula. There seems to be a public shipyard and rest stop here as well.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_2">Seeing a trade depot set up near the beacon implies there is an alien settlement on some nearby rock. You decide to check out their wares.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_3">The centre of a hydrogen cloud doesn't seem like a very usual place for a store, but the Engi aren't a usual species. Wouldn't hurt to take a look.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_4">An Engi cargo vessel hails: "Propose mutually beneficial exchange of properties." That smells like a bargain.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_5">You discover a cluster of Federation refugee ships taking shelter in the folds of the nebula. "I'm sorry we've got nothing to give you, but we need scrap to keep the engines running." You sense they'll strike a trade.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_1">This nebula must have been an important hub at one point; placing all of these jump beacons would be no easy task. However, now it's hardly navigable.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_2">Nebulas were always dangerous places. Many electronics fail in these clouds. You will have to tread lightly.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_3">You've entered a sector thick with nebulas. You'll have to navigate on instinct.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_4">You've entered a nebula-rich sector. You may put a few light years on the fleet, but that's only useful if you make it out the other side.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_5">Thanks to the high nebula density of this sector very little of it has been charted, and rumours of what lurks in the depths abound.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_NEBULA_6">The gases that make up the nebulas in this sector threaten to impair your systems; but you have to press on.</text>

<!-- data/events_pirate.xml -->
<text name="event_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_text">You jump into a perilous asteroid field. Worse, sensors show a pirate stronghold has locked onto our ship and is activating a teleporter. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="event_BOARDERS_SUN_text">You arrive to find yourself extremely close to a star. You receive a message from a pirate ship, "I'm glad you arrived; our ship is damaged and we were getting desperate... I hope you don't mind if we take yours." Hostiles detected on board our ship!</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_1_text">They appear to be filled with military supplies! You take everything you can use and jettison the rest.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_2_text">The cargo was primarily consumer goods and clothing, nothing particularly useful. You manage to collect some scrap.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_3_text">Once you bring the cargo onto your ship, a pirate bursts out of one of the crates saying, "Ugh... I was getting cramped in there. Oh, yeah! Prepare to die!" Immediately after this battle-cry your ship is filled with the sound of crates breaking open...</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_4_text">You bring the cargo aboard. Before you have a chance to open it a pirate ship appears out of hiding and charges. At the same time, the crates fly open. Intruders aboard the ship!</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_1_text">The cargo appears to contain nothing of much interest. You salvage some scrap from the destroyed ship.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_2_text">Your Advanced Sensors are able to breach the protective barrier and scan the cargo. It appears to be filled with military supplies! You take everything you can use.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_3_c1_choice">Destroy the crates to prevent another ship from falling victim.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_3_c1_text">You fire on the crates, breaking them open and scattering the pirates into empty space. A pirate ship appears out of nowhere with a message, "You will pay for that!"</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_3_c2_choice">Leave it alone and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_3_text">Your advanced sensors pick up faint life signatures inside the cargo. The life forms appear to be armed. This looks like a planned pirate ambush.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_c1_choice">Bring it aboard.</text>
<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_c2_choice">Leave it alone, this looks suspicious.</text>

<text name="event_FLOATING_CARGO_text">Not too far from the beacon, you detect a destroyed cargo ship with its cargo scattered nearby, intact.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_TELEPORTER_1_text">You beam a small team into their holds. They work quickly to free the slaves and teleport back to your ship. One of the captives seems fit for battle and you throw them a weapon in preparation for a fight.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_TELEPORTER_2_text">You teleport an away team into their hold to attempt to free their prisoners. They are able to get to one person before being caught and forced into a corner by the crew. You quickly beam the team and prisoner back to your ship.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_TELEPORTER_3_text">You beam a team onto their ship. However, your estimations of the location of their prisoners was off. By the time they get their bearings the slavers spot them. You beam them back to the ship and prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c1_choice">Buy one slave and free them to join your crew.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c2_choice">Attack the slaver scum.</text>

<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c4_choice">(Teleporter) Use your teleporter to attempt to board the ship and release some of the slaves.</text>
<text name="event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_text">You recognize the ship as a well-known slave trader. He hails you and offers you "laborers" for cheap.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_ASTEROID_c1_choice">Turn and fight.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_ASTEROID_text">A pirate ship was lying in wait inside this asteroid field. It immediately moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_c1_choice">Destroy the ship and salvage it.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_c1_text">You strip the ship of anything useful and leave its crew to hope help arrives.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_c2_choice">Use the leverage you gained by saving their lives to convince them to delay the pursuing fleet.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_c2_text">Hopefully that will buy you more time to get to the next sector.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_text">Upon closer inspection, you realize the ship under attack was a Rebel scout! It's too damaged to put up much of a fight.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_2_text">You were too late. A hull breach deprived the crew of oxygen during your fight with the pirate. You salvage what you can.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_3_text">The pirate's victim quickly jumps away before you have a chance to speak to them.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_4_text">"Thank you for the aid! I'm an arms dealer that usually only works with Rebels, but considering the circumstances I'll make an exception."</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_5_text">"Thank the heavens you showed up! We don't have much to offer as a reward, but our engineer should be proficient enough to patch your ship up a bit after that nasty fight."</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_c1_choice">Accept their bribe.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_c1_text">"Good choice, son. We've both come out of this richer."</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_BRIBER_c2_choice">Try to be a hero. Attack the pirate.</text>

<text name="event_PIRATE_CHOICE_c2_choice">Reject their 'offer'.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CHOICE_c2_text">"Too bad... You will regret this decision!"</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CHOICE_text">Upon completing your jump, you receive a message from a nearby ship. "Greetings and welcome to our beacon! For a small fee, we'll let you continue on your way."</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_c1_choice">Aid the civilian ship.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_c1_text">You power up your weapons and engage the pirate ship.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_c2_choice">Stay out of it.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_c2_text">The fight brings them out of your immediate scanning range. After a time the distress calls stop.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_NO_ESCAPE_c2_choice">(Hacking System) Counter the remote hacking.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_NO_ESCAPE_c2_text">Your Hacking System automatically counters the digital assault and you move in to fight the ship.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_NO_ESCAPE_text">Once you arrive, your screen lights up with warnings. A nearby pirate seems to have advanced hacking tools and they have tried to shut down your engines. Your crew manages to keep them barely operational and you move into attack.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_SLAVER_RUN_1_text">You quickly fire up your engines and make a break for it. However, it seems to be in vain. They catch up to you effortlessly and power up their weapons.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_SLAVER_RUN_2_text">You divert all available power to your engines and flee. You caught them off-guard, but they seem to be gaining on you. Luckily you are able to stay out of range long enough to charge the FTL drive.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_SLAVER_RUN_3_text">You fire up the engines and try to escape. Their slower ship is unable to keep pace; eventually it gives up and returns to the beacon to await an easier target.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_SLAVER_c1_c0_clone">You briefly consider cloning a replacement, but decide to respect the Federation laws regarding simultaneous duplicates.</text>
<text name="event_PIRATE_SLAVER_c1_choice">Draw straws and send a crew-member over to the slavers.</text>

<text name="event_PIRATE_SUN_text">This beacon has been placed too close to a super-giant class M star! The ship will gradually overheat until you get out of here... or die. A pirate, apparently oblivious to the danger of the sun, moves in to engage.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_1_c1_choice">Welcome aboard!</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_1_c1_text">The survivor gets on board the ship.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_1_c2_choice">Decline their request.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_1_text">The ship you saved was badly damaged in the battle. Most of the crew accepts your offer to be dropped off at a nearby station. One offers to join your crew.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_2_text">Apparently the ship that was being assaulted was a science vessel. They thank you for saving them and offer a small reward.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_3_text">It seems the crew did not survive the assault. You take what you can from the remains of the ship.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_4_c1_choice">The captain offers to install a piece of equipment on your ship.</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_4_text">They respond, "It's a good thing you came when you did; we'd be dead now otherwise. I'm a shipwright and I'd like to help you like you helped me."</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_5_text">"This sector has become increasingly dangerous for friends of the Federation. I think my crew can patch up some of your hull damage as thanks."</text>
<text name="event_SAVE_CIVILIAN_LIST_6_text">The civilian ship wisely made a fast retreat while you distracted the hostile ship.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_PIRATE_1">As soon as you arrive, a small ship de-cloaks behind yours. You immediately power up the shields and weapons, but they continue on their trajectory unimpressed. You try to calm your nerves.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_PIRATE_2">A small pirate ship messages you, "That sure is a shiny ship you got there." You fire a warning shot across their bow and they respond, "Hey! No need for violence! It was just a comment..."</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_PIRATE_3">The only thing within scanning range is an old abandoned mining structure and a resupply station. They appear to have been picked clean by marauders.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_PIRATE_4">You arrive to have a small fleet of Engi ships target you with a message, "Piracy results in negative societal impact. Not permitted." You assure them of your honest intentions and they allow you to pass.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_1">As you jump into the system a pirate advances on your position. They are refusing all hails. Prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_2">Soon after arriving in the system you are hailed by a small cruiser. "What good fortune that we happen to run into each other. Nothing personal, but you have some information we need!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_3">At first it appears you've arrived in an empty system, but a ship appears from behind a planet and hails you: "Haha! I am the dread pirate Tuco, prepare to die!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_4">The only other ship at this beacon messages you: "Finally, after months of waiting, someone has fallen into our trap!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_5">You barely have time to register jump completion before your ship warns you of an incoming ship with weapons hot.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_BRIBER_1">You come across a pirate in hot pursuit of an unidentified ship. You quickly receive a transmission from the pirate: "Stay out of this fight and we'll make it worth your while."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_BRIBER_2">An unidentified ship is badly damaged and still being assaulted by a space pirate. The victim begins a distress message until the pirate cuts in and offers to split the bounty if you sit tight.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_BRIBER_3">A missile shoots across your bow when the jump completes. Your scans quickly reveal a ship with pirate markings pursuing an unknown vessel. The pirate hails you: "Damn it, we weren't expecting company. Stay out of this and you could profit."</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_1">You arrive in the system to see a pirate ship pursuing a civilian ship. You detect messages from the civilian ship on a distress frequency.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_2">Scanners indicate that a battle is taking place nearby. It seems that someone is under attack by space pirates.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_3">You detect two ships, one chasing the other... Scanners show the pursuer is a pirate!</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_4">There are only two ships within range and they seem to be engaged in battle. One of them has the markings of a space pirate.</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_5">You arrive at the next beacon only to be immediately hailed by a small shuttle. "Help us! We are being attacked by pirates!"</text>
<text name="text_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_6">You come out of the jump to see laser blasts coming from the other side of the beacon. It looks like someone is under attack from pirates.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_PIRATE_1">A few years ago this region was bustling with trade activity. Now it is overrun with bandits and marauders. You should tread lightly here.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_PIRATE_2">This somewhat isolated region was thrown into chaos at the start of the rebellion. Even in peacetime it was always beset by pirates but now it houses a center of operations for countless pirate fleets.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_PIRATE_3">If the reports are true, this area has been under the control of pirates for quite some time. Some traders still attempt to trade with the few settlements that remain, but they do so at great risk.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_PIRATE_4">A few Federation-friendly planets still exist in this sector, but they are constantly under attack by pirate raids. This is a dangerous sector, so be careful.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_PIRATE_1">A few small ships are visible on the vidscreen, and you almost activate weapons targeting. However, sensors indicate they are simply honest merchants. The pirates must be making you jumpy. You message them asking about their wares.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_PIRATE_2">You detect a hub of activity nearby. A large corporation has set up a trade depot and has a number of well armed ships patrolling. This appears to be a relatively safe place to get repairs.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_PIRATE_3">You receive a wide-band automated message, "Welcome to our humble trade depot and shipyard! All are welcome, but try any funny business and our 152 automated turret satellites will tear your ship to shreds!"</text>
<text name="text_STORE_PIRATE_4">A well armed transport ship and a squadron of fighters are in orbit nearby. You are wary of their trustworthiness but beggars can't be choosers.</text>

<text name="event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_c1_choice">Attempt to download the ship's data stores.</text>
<text name="event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_c2_choice">Don't risk activating it, and just strip the ship for any useful scrap.</text>
<text name="event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_c3_choice">(Sensors) Remotely scan the ship.</text>
<text name="event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_text">You find a Rebel automated scout floating near this beacon. Despite its pristine condition, it appears to be de-activated.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_ITEM_LIST_1_text">The station was either abandoned or stripped clean. It seems to have lain unused for quite some time. You find nothing useful.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_ITEM_LIST_2_text">The station was apparently designed to outfit Rebel ships with Drone Systems. You find a functioning Schematic.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_ITEM_LIST_3_text">The station is a storage site for military grade weapons. You find one that can be easily attached to the ship.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_ITEM_LIST_4_text">The station is a storage site for various resources. You salvage everything possible.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_RADAR_LIST_1_text">You successfully hack into their system and transmit false information about your location. That should hold off the fleet for at least a little while.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_RADAR_LIST_2_text">The firewalls prove too difficult to bypass. As you are about to disconnect, you stumble across unprotected information about the surrounding beacons. Your map is updated.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_RADAR_LIST_3_text">You are unable to penetrate the computer's defenses. You give up and return to the ship.</text>
<text name="event_DEFENSE_RADAR_LIST_4_text">As you attempt to hack in, you set off a hidden alarm system. It seems that now the Rebels must surely be aware of your position! You hasten back to the ship to jump away.</text>
<text name="event_DOWNLOAD_DRONE_DATA_1_text">You are able to pull all of the ship's data about this sector. Your map has been updated.</text>
<text name="event_DOWNLOAD_DRONE_DATA_2_text">You accidentally reactivate the ship's AI. Its weapons immediately go online; prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_DONE_c1_text">As you are leaving you detect an interesting Federation ship signal. Apparently the Rebels were reverse engineering the advanced weaponry on a prototype Federation cruiser. You don't know how they captured the ship intact but you program its FTL drive to return the ship to the nearest Federation base. You just hope it gets there unharmed.</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_DONE_text">While the second flagship was not yet finished, it doesn't make the battle any less of a victory... and you've crippled the Rebel fleet's strength considerably! While you don't overstay your welcome, you quickly salvage choice bits of metal, drones, and even an unusual object or two from the wreckage and prepare to jump!</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_c1_choice">Look around.</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_c1_text">Warning lights flash as scans identify the gigantic ship under construction - it's a second Rebel Flagship! This must be the secret shipyards where the first one was built, and you've accidentally stumbled across it! Even in its weakened state, the Rebel ship powers up... get ready, you've got a hell of a fight on your hands.</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_c2_choice">Leave immediately.</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_c2_text">You feel the mission is the highest priority and it's too risky to stay in such a dangerous location.</text>
<text name="event_FLAGSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_text">You arrive at the beacon to find yourself in a huge Rebel shipyard, scaffolding and construction drones filling the sector! The entire system looks devoted to ship construction, the nearby planets and moons ruthlessly mined to harvest resources for a ship of immense size...</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_REBEL_BOARDING_text">There appear to be a number of small stations nearby. Before you have time to scan them, warnings go off. A Rebel teleporter was used in one of the stations. You've been boarded!</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_text">With the crew dead, you search the ship. You find military-grade weaponry and take what looks most useful.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_2_text">The ship refuses to fight, but you still detect life signatures. Apparently this was a prisoner transport. The single survivor offers to join your crew in exchange for their freedom.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_3_text">This ship was apparently carrying information about the surrounding beacons. You download what you can to the ship's map, and scrap the rest of the ship.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_4_text">Searching the remains you find that the cargo was military-grade Drone Schematics! You bring them aboard to install on your ship.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_10_text">The ship appears to have been transporting prisoners. Unfortunately they were all killed in the battle. You salvage what you can.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_11_text">The ship was carrying military supplies. You pick up anything that looks salvageable from the debris.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_1_text">You search the ship and discover that its cargo was new military-grade weaponry! It was somehow undamaged in the fight and can easily be mounted on the ship.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_2_text">You search the remains of the ship, but only come across blueprints and debris from broken machinery. A shame, but you take what scrap you can salvage.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_3_text">The ship was transporting weaponry. You find a piece still intact, despite the battle.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_4_text">The ship was apparently transporting weaponry; however, nothing seems to have survived the battle.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_5_text">Searching the remains, you find that the cargo was military-grade Drone Schematics! You bring them aboard to install in your ship.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_6_text">The debris implies that the ship was carrying Drone Schematics, but unfortunately nothing remains. You do find functioning Drone Parts, however.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_7_text">This ship's cargo was not salvageable. However, they seem to have been surveying the region; they possess detailed maps and data. You download what you can to the ship's map.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_8_text">From the bits and pieces you find, you decide that this ship was gathering information. Nothing seems useful.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_9_text">You detect faint life signatures from an intact piece of the hull. They were transporting prisoners, and the sole survivor offers to join your crew, as a first step on their path to get revenge.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_c1_choice">Demand the surrender of their goods.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_c1_text">You prepare to secure their cargo by force.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_c2_choice">Avoid the ship.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_c2_text">They stay outside your weapons range, and eventually jump away.</text>
<text name="event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_text">You spot a small Rebel ship nearby. It seems to have been re-fitted for transport rather than combat. It does not seem to want to engage you and your ship.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_c1_choice">Intervene to defend the outpost.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_c1_text">The rebel responds to your threat, "I don't know who you are, but no one defies the Rebel Fleet!" They move in to engage.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_c2_choice">Avoid the conflict.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_c2_text">The Rebel ship fires some warning shots but eventually powers down their weapons. The outpost seems to have given them what they demanded.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_text">You detect a Rebel scout on an attack approach to a small refueling outpost. Their weapons are charged, but they're not firing yet.</text>
<text name="event_SQUAT_WARNING_text">You stumble across a forward scout of the Rebel fleet.</text>
<text name="ship_FLASHSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_deadCrew_c1_choice">Pillage the ship for supplies.</text>
<text name="ship_FLASHSHIP_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_deadCrew_text">You detect no more lifesigns on the incomplete Flagship. You'd expect a ship of that size to have more security measures, but perhaps their computer systems aren't complete yet.</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_1">You receive a message from a nearby Rebel station, "You have a lot of guts passing through our space, I'll give you that." He turns giving an order, "Kill their crew, I want that ship intact."</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_2">Your sensors warn of an incoming Rebel ship at the same time as you hear the telltale signs of a teleporter. You hear someone taunt from within the ship, "Ready to die? I sure am ready to get a promotion!"</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_3">Incoming message, "Hello Captain," says a Rebel in an officer's garb. "How very generous of you to turn yourself in. Prepare to be boarded. Come quietly and we may be lenient."</text>
<text name="text_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_4">You receive a message on a low-band channel. "You're surrounded, just like the last of your Federation friends. Just die already." The enemy has teleported onto your ship!</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_REBEL_1">You enter a system bustling with Rebel activity. Supply freighters and re-supply stations are dwarfed by a few heavy warships. Luckily, no one seems to be paying attention to small cruisers. No ships are scanning or messaging you.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_REBEL_2">You arrive near a small Rebel refueling depot. Your ship is being scanned multiple times so they must recognize you, but there appears to be no combat-ready ships in the vicinity. The only message you receive is a denial to your request to dock at the depot.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_REBEL_3">There is not much of interest nearby. A small sun in the distance with a few orbiting planets in nearby space provide little of interest.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_REBEL_4">There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communication relay. You tap into it without a problem; there is no encryption. Most of the chatter revolves around troop and fleet movements, not particularly interesting.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_REBEL_5">There is a small planet nearby with scattered settlements. A small Rebel fleet is in orbit with many ships ferrying back and forth. It must be a more recently 'liberated' planet.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_1">Your ship is hailed. "We've found you at last. Prepare to die!"</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_10">A Rebel ship is guarding this beacon. You order a pursuit course and prepare to scratch up one more.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_2">A small Rebel ship is docked at a small station. You try to lay low but it spots you. Power up the weapons!</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_3">A Rebel ship has been patrolling this region. As soon as you arrive it begins its assault.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_4">A Rebel ship hails you: "Federation scum! We've waited a long time for this!"</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_5">You receive a transmission: "Sorry sir, this is nothing personal but we're under orders." The Rebel ship's weapons go hot.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_6">By the time you notice the Rebel ship behind the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_7">A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_8">A Rebel ship approaches cautiously. "Personally," says the captain, "I'd have stuck with the Federation. But I'm a soldier, sir, and I'm no use without a war to fight. Raise your shields!"</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_9">You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_1">You discover one of the Rebel's autonomous scouts. The ship's AI wastes no time in engaging your ship.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_2">Your ship is hailed: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die." It appears this Rebel ship is run by an AI.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_3">A Rebel autonomous scout is exploring this beacon. You attempt to hide behind a nearby moon, but the ship finds you and begins its assault.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_4">The AI of a nearby small Rebel scout immediately identifies you as a threat and engages.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_5">A Rebel ship moves in to engage. You attempt to open communications, but realize the futility of that action when you see the ship is run by an AI.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_6">This must be one of the Rebels' unmanned scout ships. Looks like there's no way around a fight.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_7">Another unmanned ship patrols this area. You prepare the ship for combat.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_8">This beacon is being patrolled by a unmanned scout. A fight is unavoidable.</text>
<text name="text_REBEL_AUTO_9">A small shuttle appears on the local radar. Turns out it is a Rebel automated scout!</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_REBEL_1">This sector was bustling with activity just a few years ago. Now, more than half of the jump beacons have been destroyed, many settlements have been abandoned and the Rebels patrol constantly.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_REBEL_2">This sector was hit hard by the rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly 'keeping the peace'.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_REBEL_3">Once the Federation forces were scattered, the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the 'tax collectors' and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_REBEL_4">At one point this was one of the most commonly traveled sectors. Knowing that, the Rebels have stationed a number of fleets here. Be careful.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_REBEL_5">You will have to be very cautious in this sector. The Rebels have full control and are no doubt looking for you.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_REBEL_1">You discover a re-supply station used by Rebels and civilians alike. You transmit your fake ship identification and for once, they don't seem to recognize your ship. You try to assume the air of a local as you prepare to dock.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_REBEL_2">You arrive at a small space station that is putting out wide-band broadcasts on black-market channels. You doubt they would turn away any business, regardless of allegiances.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_REBEL_3">You receive generic advertisements from a nearby public ship-yard. It seems they are willing to work on any ship, not only those of Rebel hue.</text>

<text name="event_ROCK_ATHIEST_GOOD_2_text">They seem tempted by your offer, but decide they can't risk being lied to again. They close frequencies and jump away.</text>

<text name="event_ROCK_ATHIEST_c3_text">The Rock captain is impressed by the data you've collected and agrees to stay with you until they find their footing in the galaxy.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ATHIEST_text">You encounter a small craft with minimal propulsion; its Rock crew-member explains that the Rock home-world is run on lies and propaganda that keep the populace in check, and that they want no part of it.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_LEAVE_1_text">The Rock people are not known for setting traps but you hasten to leave anyway.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_LEAVE_3_text">Before you have a chance to leave, a Rock patrol ship arrives and you intercept their comm chatter, "...appears we've finally found them. Their killing spree ends now!" Before you can plead your innocence they move in to attack.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_SLUG_1_text">You salvage what you can from the ship. No lifeforms or ships are detected nearby.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_SLUG_2_text">You begin the salvage operation but before long your crew warns you of an approaching ship. You hasten to leave before they get within firing range.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_STRIP_1_text">You salvage what you can from the ship. No one bothers you during the operation.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_STRIP_2_text">A Rock patrol ship jumps in while you are salvaging the ship. They message you, "Filthy pirates! Prepare to die!" You doubt explaining your mission will convince them of your need.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_c1_choice">Strip the ship.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_c2_choice">Leave it alone.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_c3_choice">(Slug Crew) Check for lifeforms and keep a lookout for ships while looting the wreck.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_LOOTING_text">You find a disabled rock transport floating near the beacon. You consider stripping it of useful parts but are uncertain why it's there in the first place.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_LIST_1_text">The Mantis craft are both too busy slaughtering one another to notice you. Eventually the smaller ship gets the upper hand, but they must have blown a fuse in the assault and their weapons system is inoperable. Now is the time to attack!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_LIST_2_text">The Mantis craft may have their differences, but when it comes to you they are of one mind. The smaller ship suffers a power failure as it moves to engage, but the larger one lets off a volley of fire and moves in to attack!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c1_choice">Wait, then attack the surviving Mantis.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c2_choice">Ignore them.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c2_text">There's quite enough action here already - prepare for light speed.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c3_choice">(Repair Drone) Repair the Rock ship.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c3_text">While the two Mantis fight you approach the Rock ship and send a repair drone through one of the many breaches. It fixes the ship up enough to make at least a single jump. You're surprised when, instead, they embark on a kamikaze run on the two Mantis, which results in the obliteration of all three!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c4_choice">(Hull Repair Drone) Repair their hull.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c4_text">While the two Mantis fight you approach the Rock ship and use a drone to fix up the ship. Once the breaches are fixed the life support flickers back on. In a matter of moments they are already in pursuit of one of the Mantis ships. Meanwhile the second Mantis turns toward you.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_text">A curious sight greets you at this beacon: a disabled Rock freighter drifts in space while two Mantis craft battle it out - presumably over who deserves the spoils.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c1_choice">Attack!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c1_text">No species deserves a Mantis hunter on their back - time to make the galaxy a little safer. Engage!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c2_choice">Ignore them.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c2_text">The Mantis take no interest in your ship - they're lying in wait for the next Rock ship to venture through. You're able to spin up the engines and jump at your leisure.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c3_choice">(Rock Ship) Ram the bastards.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c3_text">Before they have a chance, you ram your ship into theirs, causing irreparable damage to their engines. Luckily, your ship's armored hull is hardly dented from the impact. The Mantis ship careens away and you move in to attack.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c4_choice">(Rock Crew) Put your Rock crewmember on the comm.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c4_text">The two aliens face one another over the vidscreen. "Cave-dwelling pebble-man!" yells the furious Mantis captain. "See, I paint my ship with your companions! I paint my ship with you!"</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_text">A Mantis ship here is adorned with Rock body parts! It would be a gorier display if they had internal organs, but the message is clear enough: this is a hunter of a very specialized kind.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_NURSERY_AUTHORITY_1_c1_text">The students secure the remaining staff and prepare to leave the solar system - there is only one path open to them now, that of the outlaw.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_NURSERY_AUTHORITY_1_text">Things, in the end, do not go well. The enemy succeeds in flanking your team and they're forced to retreat to the ship.</text>

<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_1_text">Your crewmember dons a space suit and exits the airlock. They make quick work of the basic device and return inside to relief all round. The mine makes good scrap pickings too.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_2_c1_choice">Red!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_2_c2_choice">Blue!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_2_text">Your crewmember dons a space suit and exits the airlock. When they open up the mine housing, though, they panic. The red wire or the blue?! 3... 2... 1...</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_c1_choice">Send someone out there to defuse it.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_c2_choice">(Missile Weapon) Attempt a controlled detonation using a missile.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_c2_text">After drawing straws, a crewmember goes out to fix a modified warhead to the mine. You detonate the missile in a way that dislodges the mine. It blows up shortly after. The ship takes some damage in the blasts, but you're still sailing.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_c3_choice">(Beam Drone) Use a drone to cut away the mine with a precision beam.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_c3_text">Carefully guided from the bridge, your beam drone removes the mine's grappling arms and sends it drifting off into space, where you shoot at it until it detonates at a safe distance.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_choice">Attempt evasive maneuvers.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_text">The ship's turning circle proves too wide and the mine bites down onto the hull. You can hear it now, chewing through the armor.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c2_choice">(Improved Engines) Reverse thrusters!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c2_text">It stresses the inertial dampeners, but you reverse course and outrun the mine. You prepare to jump off.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_text">The burnt out hull of a Rock mine layer drifts by. Behind the wreck drifts a live mine; an automated drone that drills into ships' hulls before exploding. It locks onto your ship's signature and heads your way!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c1_choice">"We're going to save them or die trying."</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c1_text">"The latter being more likely. Still... we can potentially help you and your precious fleet, but you'll need to prove yourself first. Meet us at these coordinates." They jump away.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c2_choice">"We're strong enough to destroy you!"</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c2_text">"One ship is not the same as a fleet, but at least you've got some fire. Meet us at these coordinates if you want to prove to us that the Federation is worth saving." They jump away.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c3_choice">Ignore them.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_c3_text">"Heh. Like I expected. If the Federation is as weak as you it deserves to fall." They jump away without another word.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK1_text">You are immediately messaged by an imposing looking Rock war vessel, "You're the ship off to 'save the Federation,' aren't you? And you expect to survive with that hunk of junk?"</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK2_text">You arrive at the coordinates given and find yourself dangerously close to an M-class star! The other ship messages you, "Let's see how long your puny ship can handle this heat! Prepare for a challenge!"</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK3_c1_c1_text">"Now that that's taken care of, let us patch up your hull. Maybe we can improve its armor plating while we're at it."</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK3_c1_text">"I am convinced of your strength and pledge to assist your cause. We'll immediately send an advanced cruiser to the Federation fleet and we will prepare our warships to move out."</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_UNLOCK3_text">You arrive at a massive Rockman shipyard and notice the ship that had just tried to kill you is docked and already being repaired. "Well fought! I must say I did not expect you to survive."</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c1_choice">Stay and defend the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c1_text">The... extreme nature of Rock faith is well-known; the Zoltan can hardly be blamed for trying to broaden their horizons. The pursuing Rock ship quickly assesses the situation and decides two captured alien ships are better than one.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c2_choice">Stay and capture the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c2_text">This is Rock territory, and therefore Rock law - the Zoltan should have known better than to interfere. You'll have to disable their engines and piloting to ensure their safe capture.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c3_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c3_text">This is none of your concern - power up the jump drive!</text>
<text name="event_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_text">It seems a Zoltan ship came here to liberate a Rock settlement from their 'oppressive belief system', and that the settlement did not appreciate it - long-range scanners suggest the Zoltan and their pursuers will be here at any moment!</text>
<text name="ship_MANTIS_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_destroyed_text">In the time it took you to eliminate the Mantis ship the Rock must have repaired their FTL drive and jumped away. You pick the bones of both Mantis vessels.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_QUEST_MARRIAGE_destroyed_text">His escort eliminated, the Grand Basilisk dispatches his entire fleet. There's just time to take your pick from the wreck before you jump out of their reach.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ROCK_deadCrew_text">With the ship's crew dead you salvage the ship before contacting the Zoltans.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ROCK_destroyed_c1_text">The Zoltan show little emotion, but express their gratitude with a small payment.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ROCK_destroyed_text">The Rock ship's hull breaks apart. You salvage the wreck before contacting the Zoltan ship.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ZOLTAN_deadCrew_text">By the time the Rock ship arrives you've all but tied a bow around their quarry. The injured and dying Zoltan are easily taken into custody and the Rock ship grudgingly transfers over what you assume must be the bounty.</text>
<text name="ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ZOLTAN_destroyed_text">The Rock ship arrives just as you put the finishing blows to the Zoltan ship. They're not of a mind to thank you, and you get the impression it'd be best if you left post-haste...</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_1">You receive a message meant to degrade you as aliens. You half expect an attack but it seems to have come from a small civilian shuttle.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_2">No one bothers your ship as you float among numerous space stations and mining platforms. The Rock certainly run efficient operations.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_3">You arrive and detect signs of battle. A few ships are taking passes at each other near a small station. You don't know if it's a territory issue, a contest or a rite of passage but you decide it's best to stay out of it.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_4">There's not much at this beacon. Just a few abandoned depots, stripped clean.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_5">A few freighters pass by but they refuse all communications. Must not want to sully their reputation by talking with foreigners.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_6">You see a small trading post and ask about refuelling but they respond, "Go away! We don't serve your kind here."</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ROCK_7">You see a Zoltan merchant and ask about his wares. He responds, "Sorry, but it took years to gain their trust. I can't be seen communicating with you. I hope you understand." He cuts communications.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_ATHIEST_BAD_1">They barely hear out your appeals before yelling, "These are the lies I sought to escape!" Looks like they're charging weapons!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_ATHIEST_BAD_2">They listen to your appeals and whisper, "Traitors to truth. You're no better than them!" Chaos ensues.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_1">You arrive in an asteroid field and immediately begin evasive maneuvers when a loud clunk reverberates through the ship. At first you think the hull has been hit, but the noise came from some Rock intruders teleporting aboard the ship!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_2">Your shields are being taxed as they deflect the debris from an asteroid field. As you weave your way between the rocks, you happen upon a Rock pirate stronghold. You register teleport signatures and hear shouts aboard the ship.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_SHIP_1">You passively scan a small Rock station that is next to the beacon. However they must not have appreciated your curiosity. A Rock ship pulls away from the station and you register an incoming teleporter signal as well!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_SHIP_2">You find a Rock ship docked with a damaged Mantis fighter. Before you have a chance to hail them, the ship moves in to attack you and you register teleporter symbols from the disabled ship. They're using Mantis tech to board you!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_SUN_1">As soon as you arrive you hear the telltale sounds of a teleporter and shouts reverberating through the ship, "Prepare to burn, fleshy meat-sack aliens!"</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_BOARDERS_SUN_2">With their high resistance to heat, outlaw Rocks often settle very close to stars. That is why it is hardly surprising when your ship gets boarded as you stumble past a hidden settlement.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_FIGHT_ASTEROID_1">A Rock mining vessel is harvesting the mineral-rich asteroids in this locality, and their scouts take your presence to be a transgression. Battle stations!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_FIGHT_ASTEROID_2">A rookie Rock cargo ship has taken its orders too literally and took the most direct route to their destination... right through an asteroid field. They're confused and fire wildly as you jump in.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_FIGHT_ASTEROID_3">The captain of a Rock freighter lost in the asteroid field hails you: "Our co-ordinates led us here, but only death greets us. What must be must be. Death to all." You power up the battle systems and wonder how long they've been stuck here.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_1">As a naturally warlike species with few inter-galactic diplomatic ties, the Rock people have garnered quite a reputation as fearsome pirates. You stumble across one of their ships and they promptly live up to type.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_2">A Rock ship flies past your windows and you recognize outcast decorations on the hull. These must be pirates!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_3">A motley collection of Rock ships are stationed around this beacon - they look to have resorted to a pirate's life. Defensive maneuvers!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_4">As a naturally warlike species with few intergalactic diplomatic ties, the Rock people have garnered quite a reputation as fearsome pirates. You stumble across one of their ships and they promptly live up to type.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_ASTEROID_1">Minute fissures in the shields spark and crackle as the ship jumps into the wake of a huge asteroid. More asteroids follow, as does a lost and aggressive Rock pirate ship.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_ASTEROID_2">You exit the jump surrounded by dirt and rocks. Before long a blast is deflected by your shield, but that was no asteroid... Incoming pirate!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_SUN_1">Unusual solar activity in this region means you need to get out, quick. The Rock pirate nearby apparently thinks otherwise as they move to attack your ship.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_PIRATE_SUN_2">A Rock ship is silhouetted against a sun in supernova. They hail: "Even out here you follow us! We only wish to be left alone!" Out of panic or anger, they charge their weapons.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_1">You encounter a Rock vessel and attempt to open trading frequencies, but they take it as an act of cultural transgression and open fire.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_2">You jump into the middle of a Rock excavation project on a nearby moon. Unimpressed with your intrusion they move to defend themselves!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_3">You intercept chatter from an approaching Rock ship: "Weapons, moving in to engage, arm the tubes." There is no talking to these guys.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_4">As you jump in, a vast figure appears on the view-screen. The Rock captain rubs the green, moss-like appendage on his chin and then orders his crew to open fire.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_5">It looks quiet, but you realize your computer is being scanned. A hidden Rock vessel hails you: "Why do you fill your computer with lies?! These are not the holy words!" Before you can interject they open fire.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_6">You notice a Rock ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_7">A loud 'thud' resounds through the ship after jump completion - you've just shunted a Rock fighter and he's already preparing to fire!</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_8">You're intercepted by a Rock salvage operation. They don't seem to mind that you're still on board while they junk your ship.</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_SURRENDER_1">The Rock ship hails: "Enough! We were told aliens were a threat to our ways, and you have proved as much. Take this and leave us in peace."</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_SURRENDER_2">Their systems suffering, the Rock ship attempts to make contact: "Alien vessel. Cease your attack. We will pay."</text>
<text name="text_ROCK_SHIP_SURRENDER_3">The Rock ship moves into a defensive position and transmits a white flag signal. They seem willing to buy their lives.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ROCK_1">The Rock people have a particularly aggressive stance toward alien races trespassing in their space. You should tread carefully here.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ROCK_2">The Rock people are a powerful and proud race. It is not unheard of to have a peaceful journey through their lands, but don't count on it.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ROCK_1">You cross paths with a Rock ship returning from a rare diplomatic mission. Equally surprising, the captain responds to your hails and agrees to a mutual trade.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ROCK_2">You come across a Rock trading post. It's rare they deal with outsiders, but they need to sell the last of their stock, and will pay their dues for their transgression when they return home.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ROCK_3">With the local Rock settlements so unwilling to trade with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piracy activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ROCK_4">The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan - a few of them have established a trading post in the husk of an abandoned capital ship.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ROCK_5">You receive a hail on Federation frequencies: "You're Federation?! We- we weren't sure we'd ever see a friendly face again. There's little business here, perhaps you'd like to trade?"</text>

<!-- data/events_ships.xml -->
<text name="ship_AUTO_FEDERATION_BASE2_destroyed_c1_text">You contact the station once the Rebel ship is destroyed. The lone survivor responds, "This base is no longer safe. Let me join your crew and I'll have the station's drones patch up your ship."</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FEDERATION_BASE2_destroyed_text">You scrap the wreckage.</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FEDERATION_BASE_destroyed_c1_text">With the threat gone, you contact the Federation outpost. They respond, "Our location has been compromised! Take everything you can and please drop our survivors off at the next station." One soldier offers to stay and fight.</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FEDERATION_BASE_destroyed_text">You scrap the wreckage.</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FUEL_SELLER_destroyed_text">As the ship breaks apart, you frantically try to salvage the remaining fuel from its cargo.</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FUEL_SELLER_escape_text">It is apparent that the ship was not intended for combat. It seems to be trying to jump away.</text>
<text name="ship_AUTO_FUEL_SELLER_gotaway_text">The ship jumps away without a word. You hope they didn't leave to get reinforcements.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_deadCrew_text">The crew of the enemy ship has been eliminated. You scrap what you can. The rest of the convoy used the time to put a significant amount of distance between you and them. Nothing left to do but jump.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_destroyed_text">The Crystalline ship shatters and you pick what you can from the debris. The rest of the convoy used the time to put a significant amount of distance between you and them. Nothing left to do but jump.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_c1_c1_text">They apologize for their hasty response to your presence and spend some time refueling and repairing both ships.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_c1_choice">Stop the fight.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_c1_text">They accept your explanation and allow you to approach the fleet. It appears they are miners and colonists from a fringe settlement who are fleeing to more protected space after hearing reports of pirate and Rebel attacks.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_c2_choice">Finish them off.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_c2_text">They wanted to pick a fight with you so that's what they'll get.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_CONVOY_surrender_text">Their ship seems severely damaged and they look to be reconsidering the fight. Should you power down your weapons and explain that you mean no threat?</text>

<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_HUNTER_surrender_c1_choice">Accept their surrender.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_HUNTER_surrender_c1_text">They send one of their prisoners over to your ship. They're a bit shaken up and you suspect that they were once a Rebel, but they seem very glad to be free.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_HUNTER_surrender_c2_choice">Finish them off.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_HUNTER_surrender_c2_text">Who knows how many humans will be saved if you kill them now.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_HUNTER_surrender_text">The hunters message you, "We surrender. Take one of these squishy meat sacks that we've captured." He must be referring to the human captives.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_SHIP_surrender_c1_choice">Accept their surrender.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_SHIP_surrender_c2_choice">Ignore them.</text>
<text name="ship_CRYSTAL_SHIP_surrender_c2_text">You cut off communications and prepare to finish them off.</text>
<text name="ship_DISTRESS_ENGI_REBEL_destroyed_text">The Rebels destroyed, you pick the bones of their ship and wait for the small Engi ship to catch up.</text>
<text name="ship_FUEL_OFF_ENGI_DUBIOUS_deadCrew_text">With the hostile Engies subdued you carefully extract as much fuel as possible from the ship.</text>

<text name="ship_JELLY_UNLOCK3_destroyed_text">With the escort destroyed you take a look at your impressive prize. Your mission is too pressing to take a test flight. Before you rig the ship's computer to guide it back to the main Federation hangar you discover a unique augment that duplicates the Slug's ability to heal breaches!</text>

<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_SLUG_1">A huge Slug teleports from nowhere onto the bridge! Before you can open fire, he's spread his wares across the helm and is brandishing things at you.</text>
<text name="text_NEBULA_STORE_SLUG_2">You cautiously approach a Slug colony on a huge asteroid. It's a brave person who sets foot on a Slug planet - it can take weeks to get the mucus out of your clothes - but there's business to be done.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_SLUG_1">You arrive at the beacon and are relieved at the sight of open space. Nebulas are terribly claustrophobic.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_SLUG_2">This beacon marks a 'small' gap in the nebula. No colonies or ships in scanning distance.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_SLUG_3">You are relieved to see your sensors blink back on after the jump. No ships detected.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_SLUG_4">The Slugs rely heavily on their telepathic powers and are reluctant to give up that advantage by extending beyond nebulas. It's unlikely you'll encounter any this far from the clouds.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_SLUG_5">You arrive in an area clear of nebula and quickly check to see if the sensors are working. Everything is fine and no ships are detected in the vicinity.</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_PIRATE_1">There appears to be a pirate ship nearby. Be on your guard; anyone trying to hunt in Slug territory is either formidable or deeply stupid, and in space, either can be dangerous.</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_PIRATE_2">"We knew anyone foolish enough to try and sneak through a Slug nebula would stick to open space. Yield your goods and we may let you live." You cut the transmission in lieu of a response.</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_PIRATE_3">Before you can take a moment's rest from the ever present nebulas in this sector, a pirate ship appears behind you and opens fire.</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_REBEL_1">As you arrive at the beacon, a hostile ship immediately registers on your scanners. You didn't expect to see Rebels extending their reach into Slug territory. Charge the weapons!</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_REBEL_2">You jump into empty space and are relieved to see your sensors blink back to life. However, you are less pleased to see them immediately register a rebel ship on an approach vector!</text>
<text name="text_SLUG_REBEL_3">You receive a message from a nearby ship, "Looks like our intelligence was correct! Sneaking through the clouds with the Slugs... No one can hide from the rebellion!"</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_SLUG_1">The only thing that can render a nebula more dangerous is if it's also home to the Slugs. This particular nebula is just that.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_SLUG_2">This nebula is home to the telepathic Slugs. They'd sell their own slime for a crate of scrap, but they much prefer to just take it.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_SLUG_3">You're told the Slug home world is somewhere in this nebula. You can't see them, but you know they're watching.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_SLUG_4">The Slugs that live in this nebula field are a leisure-centered civilization. Everything in Slug life is done in the pursuit of more currency and more time in which to spend it on extravagant ventures. This, inevitably, leads to much treachery in open space.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_SLUG_5">The Slugs developed on an ocean planet where the ability to telepathically sense another organism was more important than sight. Today they use this ability to navigate unfettered the depths of the nebulas they inhabit.</text>
<text name="text_STORM_SLUG_FIGHT_1">The ion storm here threatens to deactivate your core systems, a fact made all the worse for the largely unaffected Slug ships circling like space-vultures.</text>
<text name="text_STORM_SLUG_FIGHT_2">The Slug ship that descends into view as you enter the ion storm must have sensed your distress - defensive action!</text>
<text name="text_STORM_SLUG_FIGHT_3">You arrive in the middle of an ion storm. Slugs generally avoid these storms but you find one waiting in ambush. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="text_STORM_SLUG_FIGHT_4">You find yourself stuck in the middle of an ion storm with a Slug ship just a short distance away, refusing all hails. You cautiously try to slip further into the clouds, but they turn suddenly to attack!</text>

<!-- data/events_zoltan.xml -->
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_LIST_1_text">As you approach, an ancient alien voice speaks to you: "Your mission has brought you great battles, and great losses. This will help ease the pain." A few minutes later someone reports medical equipment has appeared on the ship!</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_LIST_2_text">You approach the planet and wait, but nothing happens. The Zoltan hail: "And in the coming times, when the monolith speaks not with a man he has no future and must be left wanting."</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_LIST_3_text">You approach the planet carefully, trying to keep your ship from breaking up in orbit. The monolith, whatever it is, must sense as much because the next thing you know you have enough scrap to patch up your damage and more besides!</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_LIST_4_c0_clone">You check your Cloning Bay but it lies dormant. Whatever just happened to your crewmember must be irreversible.</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_LIST_4_text">As you approach, a kaleidoscope of colors fills the viewscreen and one of your crew begins to age rapidly in reverse, eventually disappearing into nothingness. Let's hope they've transcended physical existence, and not just been forced out of it.</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_c1_choice">Pull the ship in closer.</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_c2_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_c2_text">Your mission is to save the Federation, not discover new wonders around the galaxy. You prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_EYE_text">Inside this nebula you detect a rogue planet drifting through space, on its surface a huge monolith visible at this distance even to the naked eye. A Zoltan elder hails you from the planet. "Through luck or intent, you have discovered the Great Eye. Look into its depths and receive your just deserts."</text>
<text name="event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_ROCK_text">This nebula turns out to be the hiding place of a terrified rock crew taking refuge from the Zoltan border police. They don't seem prepared to risk your leaving with their co-ordinates, and open fire!</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c1_choice">Secure the fuel supply.</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c1_text">You jet toward the pirate with the fuel supplies and engage - hopefully you can leave the ship in one piece!</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c2_choice">Secure the ammunition.</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c2_text">You jet toward the pirate with the ammunition and engage - hopefully you can leave the ship in one piece!</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c3_choice">Let them leave.</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_c3_text">Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.</text>
<text name="event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE_text">You spy two pirate ships lurking in the nebula here. They remain unaware of your presence; you're able to get your scanners to at least identify their cargo: One is carrying the fuel supplies, the other the ammunition. They begin to drift away from each other in the storm.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ASTEROID_text">You arrive in an asteroid field and are greeted by a Zoltan guard, "By attempting to access these closed mining fields, you are in violation of the Natural Mineral Protection Act. Your weaponry will be confiscated for processing." You don't have time for this.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_BOARDERS_MANTIS_text">The Mantis outcasts sometimes make the mistake of taking the Zoltan for easy game. A scout moves in to attack while a boarding party beams aboard from a nearby transport!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_BOARDERS_text">There are few more zealous in their customs checks than the Zoltan. A team of border police beam on board. There's just a little confusion over your weapons licences, but things escalate rapidly from heated discussion to gunfire!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_1_text">The Zoltan security staff board your ship and scan the crew's faces into a computer. After a few tense moments of uncertainty they allow your ship to pass.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c1_c0_clone">Unfortunately your crewmember was taken away unharmed so your Clone Bay was unable to retrieve them.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c1_choice">Give up your crewmember.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c1_text">It's a tough call, but Zoltan law holds sway here. Besides, that one always seemed a bit shifty.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c2_choice">Refuse and fight.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c2_text">You're not going to leave anyone behind. You pull away from the station with the enemy guards on board. Unfortunately, they are able to sabotage your weapon system in the chaos. It's time to leave!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_text">The Zoltan security staff board your ship and begin scanning the crew's faces into a computer. Suddenly alarms go off and the Zoltan leap on one of your crew! "This person is wanted on five charges of Utter Villainy! Surrender them to us!"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c1_choice">You don't have time for this nonsense. Attack!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c1_text">Expecting resistance, their Energy Shield is raised and ready for combat.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c2_choice">Submit to profiling.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c3_choice">(Slug Crew) Have your Slug talk them into letting you go.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c3_text">You give the guards permission to dock with the ship, but before they come on board your crewmember slowly advances to meet them. As far as you can tell no words were exchanged, but the guards offer you some supplies and say the ship checks out. Best to not ask questions.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c4_choice">(Mind Control) Make the guards believe they have already checked your crew today.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c4_text">The captain of the guard appears on the vid screen "Back so soon friend! Well, no need to waste your time further. Here, take these spare fuel canisters and get on with your mission." Your ship is cleared to pass.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_text">You arrive at a Zoltan security checkpoint set up in a perimeter around the beacon. "Travelling vessel, you will submit to crew profiling to identify fugitives of the empire."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c1_choice">Interfere and save the Mantis ship.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c1_text">Sometimes you have to bet on the underdog - even on the rare occasions that the underdog is a Mantis warship. You set off for the heart of the asteroid field and engage the Zoltan there.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c2_choice">Interfere and help the Zoltan ship.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c2_text">You overtake the Zoltan and catch up with the Mantis ship in the asteroid belt. Time to make some friends.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c3_choice">Don't interfere.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_c3_text">The Zoltan know their business better than most - best to leave them to it. You prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_MANTIS_text">Your jump interrupts a Zoltan security ship as it follows a Mantis pirate into an asteroid field. They message you, "Your presence here will continue to be tolerated - but please, do not interfere."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_DISTRESS_SHELL_text">You arrive to find a lumbering Zoltan freighter with no one at the helm. It's a mystery what happened to the crew, but it'd be a shame to let the opportunity go to waste.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ENGI_text">You jump into a debris field that used to be a Zoltan cruiser. Unfortunately, its Engi escort takes you for the attacker and retaliates! They refuse all hails.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_FREE_AUGMENT_text">A Zoltan academy sits docked just outside the beacon perimeter. They're happy to show you the fruits of their labor, and offer something to take home with you.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_FREE_MAP_text">The Zoltan stationed near this beacon are happy to receive you. As they give you the formal tour of their ship you spy some local star charts and mentally log the details.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_HIRE_1_text">He responds haughtily, "You would presume I would work under your command after such a display of... prowess? No, I must decline."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_HIRE_2_text">He responds defeatedly, "I suppose I have nowhere else to go without a ship. I accept your offer."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_c1_choice">Engage the pirates.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_c2_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_c2_text">You refuse to get his ship back, but still offer to drop him off at the next station. The Zoltan is displeased, but directs you to a nearby starbase just the same.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_text">You pick up a Zoltan life raft floating in space. Its inhabitant asks you to retake his ship from the pirates who recently commandeered it. "I'm certain it is clear," he concludes, "that you must not destroy my vessel in the process."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_MANTIS_text">You pick up the last broadcast from a rupturing Zoltan freighter: "The Mantis, they're here, please-" You're interrupted by fire off the port bow!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_1_text">A closer inspection reveals signs of habitation on the surface, but nothing else particularly interesting.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_2_text">Sending a shuttle to explore a beckoning cave system you discover signs of a battle - and a still-functioning weapon!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_3_text">A deep scan of the surface reveals a cave system that runs for miles, and what looks like a scrap heap left over from some heavy-duty construction.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_4_c1_choice">Attempt to detonate some explosives to break through the surface. [ Missiles: -1 ]</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_4_c2_choice">Explosives are too valuable to waste on excavation work. Let's get out of here.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_CHECK_4_text">It looks as if a team could break through the fragile layer of the moon's surface into a hidden cavern.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_EXPLOSION_1_text">A portion of the surface layer is destroyed in an impressive display, revealing miles of caves. You don't have time to fully explore them, but you find some remains of an old subterranean base that could be useful.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_EXPLOSION_2_text">The explosives are set remotely, but the detonation achieves nothing. What a waste.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_EXPLOSION_3_text">Your explosives reveal the 'cave' is actually a secret base, located in a network of bunkers just under the surface. Everyone inside is dead; some Mantis clearly came through here recently. It looks like the Zoltan were researching advanced ship weaponry. You take one of their better examples back to your ship.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c1_choice">Check it out.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c2_choice">Leave it be.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c2_text">You try not to fixate on the moon in the aft scanner as you set the coordinates for the next jump.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c3_c1_text">Your drone discovers a vast cave network and evidence of excavation. Buried deep below you find a Zoltan scientist, still hard at work. He tells you that all his colleagues are long dead. You decide not to ask questions and offer to let him join your crew.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c3_choice">(Boarding Drone) Send a drone to probe the surface.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c3_text">Initial scans indicate a network of caves not far underground. You launch a boarding drone and it breaks through the surface into the cavern below.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_text">Something strikes you as odd about a moon in the distance.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c1_choice">Attack.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c1_text">You power your weapons and prepare to fight.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_c1_choice">The galaxy is huge - you can find a place for your ideals elsewhere without causing this destruction.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_c1_text">"No! We will not be consigned to the backwaters of space just because we don't fit into your 'Federation ideals'!" They charge.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_c2_choice">True progress can only be achieved without bloodshed.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_c2_text">Suddenly all indications of the Rebel ship fade away and a Zoltan fleet appears around your ship. The captain of the ship you met previously materializes on your bridge.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_choice">"Perhaps there could be a reconciliation of our ideals without war?"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c1_text">"Our ideals are too different to be so easily reconciled. You think this could end any way but war?"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c2_choice">"Surrender. Your ultimate destruction is inevitable. We've left scores of Rebels destroyed in our wake."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c2_text">They shut off communications and immediately engage.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c3_choice">"Your Rebellion is causing millions of deaths. Your beliefs are dividing the galaxy. Unity is the only option!"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_c3_text">"Humans are treated as 'equal' to aliens in the weak Federation. The sacrifice of BILLIONS of alien or human lives are justified if it means we reach our full potential!" They charge.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_choice">Attempt to hail them.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_text">They open communications: "I can't imagine there's anything you could say that will save you. The rebellion must destroy those that are still loyal to the obsolete Federation."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_text">You arrive at the location specified by the peace-loving Zoltan, but the only thing nearby is a Rebel ship, closing in fast! "We've found you! You're not getting away this time!"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_ATTACK_1_text">You charge your weapons - not that this will take much.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_ATTACK_2_text">Just as you're preparing to attack you detect a nearby jump signature. A Zoltan defense ship comes to their aid!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_REWARD_1_text">"Although your methods are crude and most certainly ineffective, it is clear you took our previous meeting to heart. If your ship represents the Federation's willingness to adapt we shall do what we can to aid in their fight. This technology should aid your quest."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_REWARD_2_text">"Although your methods are crude and most certainly ineffective, it is clear you took our previous meeting to heart. If your ship represents the Federation's willingness to adapt we shall do what we can to aid in their fight. I will personally assist."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c1_choice">Attack them.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c2_c1_text">They finish: "Please, spread the word of enlightenment to those that have not heard. Once you have, contact our brethren." They transmit coordinates of their so-called "brethren".</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c2_choice">Hear them out.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c2_text">They continue. "We take your silence for interested contemplation." They talk at length about peace and harmony, but either it's beyond your simple mind or it's all nonsense.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c3_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_c3_text">The galaxy is at war - there's no time for talk of peace. You leave their hails unanswered and charge the jump drive.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST_text">An unarmed Zoltan transport vessel is slowly making its way toward the beacon here. They hail: "This is a Zoltan peace envoy. We carry no weapons or shielding and rely on the mercy of others to communicate our message."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c1_choice">Interfere - make first contact with the primitive aliens.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c1_text">The local people - furry, one-eyed tree lizard things - begin chanting when they see you. Suddenly the sky is lit by laser fire - the Zoltan opened fire on your ship! You dash back to the shuttle and join the fight.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c2_choice">Protect the aliens' way of life - Attack the Rebel ship.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c2_text">These creatures should be left to develop at their own pace. You direct all weapons on the Rebel ship and begin the firing sequence.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c3_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_c3_text">You don't want to alert the Rebels of your presence and you don't want to anger the Zoltan in their territory. The best solution is to leave.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_text">You tap into their frequency and hear the Rebel captain yelling, "We are liberating this planet in the name of the new Galactic government! These aliens will not be left in ignorance where they cannot be of use!"</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_text">You arrive at the primitive planet that you heard about at the cantina and are surprised to see a Zoltan ship facing off against a Rebel assault craft.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c1_choice">Mantis.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c1_text">"You like a challenge. So be it!" A wormhole forms and a confused, angry Mantis ship hurtles toward you!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c2_choice">Slug.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c2_text">"Do not be fooled, Federation, by a soft underbelly." You detect a wormhole opening up, and seconds later a Slug ship is attacking from the other direction!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c3_choice">Rockmen.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c3_text">"A hardened foe for a hardened veteran." You detect a wormhole opening up, and a Rock ship appears with guns blazing. It appears they were in combat when they were thrust across space-time.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_text">You come to a quiet part of Zoltan space and encounter an ancient Zoltan wise man who has managed to harness the power of a spatial rift, but seems to have been driven completely mad by the power. "Choose your doom," he demands. This is all part of a day's work.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_RIFT_SUCCESS_text">When he sees you have emerged victorious, the Zoltan wise man enters a rage. Rifts threaten to tear space apart until, instead, the Zoltan implodes, sending a blast wave of scrap and salvage dragged here from distant worlds in your direction.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_LIST_1_text">You allow them to approach, but are caught unaware when they open fire!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_LIST_2_text">"We have been studying the relationships between the species and have determined that the 'Federation' still has potential to be a net positive for the galaxy. Please accept this gift to aid your journey."</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_c1_choice">Dock with them.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_c2_choice">Have them keep their distance.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_c2_text">They leave without a word.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_text">What appears to be a Zoltan science ship requests permission to dock.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_c1_choice">Accept their offer.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_c2_choice">We will not accept surrender!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_SUCCESS_1_text">You head into a ship supply store. It is a well-equipped, self-service affair. An order is dialled into a terminal, scrap is deposited, and the item is dispatched from a nearby chute.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_SUCCESS_2_c1_text">You overhear one group discussing a newly discovered planet yet to have first contact, and note down its location.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_SUCCESS_2_text">You head into the cantina for gossip. Topics of conversation in the cantina range from crop distribution microbes to the joys of Slug pleasure cruises.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_TALK_1_text">They don't see many of your species in these parts, and you stick out like a Casvagarian Sea Slug in a Plutonian Shrimp Stew. You make it back to the ship with a gang of Zoltan guards in tow!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_TALK_2_text">You pose as traders and succeed in bypassing airlock security - however, it's only a matter of time before someone realizes your ID cards are counterfeit!</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c1_choice">Try to talk your way in.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c2_choice">(Teleporter) Beam directly to the civilian deck.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c2_text">You re-materialize in a dark corner of the main concourse and are able to conduct your investigations in peace.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c3_choice">(Zoltan Crew) Present his official documentation and pay the entry fee.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c3_text">They scan ID that declares your crewmember an official citizen, collect their fee, and let you pass.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c4_choice">Leave.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_c4_text">You don't have the papers - well, the neuro-laced identity bracelets - to get in, so best not to try.</text>
<text name="event_ZOLTAN_TRADE_HUB_text">You come to a Zoltan trade and supply hub - everything the weary traveler needs, provided they have the right documentation.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_1">There are some mineral-rich asteroids here that the Zoltan have left idle, but you've none of the necessary equipment to mine them.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_2">You have to admit - Zoltan space is a beautiful and peaceful place indeed. However, re-engaging the FTL and finishing your mission is your priority, not sight-seeing.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_3">A light asteroid field is entering the atmosphere of a nearby planet - a fireworks show on a galactic scale. There's little for it but to take in the ambience and program the next jump.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_4">You stumble upon some Zoltan military vessels engaging in combat training. Their Energy Shields are impressive, but you note how quickly beam and ion weaponry take them down.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_5">You don't have time to hail the Zoltan ship that was waiting at this beacon before it jumps away. They are a careful race.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_6">A Zoltan shipyard is stationed at this beacon. You admire the display of hundreds of glowing Zoltan performing delicate exterior work on a massive transport ship.</text>
<text name="text_NOTHING_ZOLTAN_7">A message broadcast from a nearby planet announces the presence of an ancient Zoltan monastery available for visiting. Likely just a tourist trap, but still too bad you don't have the time to visit.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ZOLTAN_1">You've entered Zoltan territory. This species is not renowned for giving anything for nothing, but you can always be assured a fair hearing.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ZOLTAN_2">The Zoltan patrol their borders but let you pass when you ID as Federation. Let's hope they won't be so courteous to the Rebels.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ZOLTAN_3">You arrive in Zoltan space. From what you have heard they anticipated the coming war and made preparations to hold their borders.</text>
<text name="text_START_BEACON_ZOLTAN_4">You're far from Federation home space here in Zoltan territory, and it's not clear whether the authorities will have any goodwill remaining. Still, you have to push forward.</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ZOLTAN_1">The Zoltan are fascinated by other species, and have set up something of an alien knick-knack shop here. Why not take a look?</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ZOLTAN_2">A human ship hails: "My friends! Please, there is nothing I don't have, and there is nothing worth wanting that I can't get. Why not take a look around my shop?"</text>
<text name="text_STORE_ZOLTAN_3">A Mantis crew here has hunkered down in the abdomen of a long-dead space-whale - the only way, presumably, for them to operate their black-market trade without detection. Worth a look?</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_1">A Zoltan ship makes contact. "The nature of the day is rotational. The fever is emaciated. The reason is-" They've caught some nasty deep space dementia. Before you can consider finding help for them, they open fire.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_2">You're surprised when a stationary Zoltan ship opens fire. It appears there are aggressive pugilists even among the 'enlightened'.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_3">You receive a message, "This area is off limits. Submit your ship to processing." It's only one guard ship in a lonely beacon. You decide to fight your way out.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_4">You discover a number of Zoltan civilian ships fighting off pirates. Unfortunately one ship mistakes your purpose and moves in to attack! They are refusing all communication; you have no choice but to fight.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_5">Like many areas in Zoltan space, the residents of this sector prepared well for Galactic war. The military here seem to have given up reasoning with foreigners, preferring instead to attack on sight!</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_6">A Zoltan ship is waiting at this beacon. They request your identification, but radiation from the sun in this system is disrupting your communications. They take your silence for aggression and move in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_7">The Zoltan ship patrolling this area hails you: "This area is off limits. Secrecy is vital." They power their weapons.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_1">"Emergency, all ships in range, we are under attack!" The frequency matches a nearby Zoltan ship; you move in on their pursuer. They take your intervention as a cue to jump away. Cowards.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_2">You jump just in time to witness a Zoltan ship's FTL drive overload. In his final moments their captain implores you not to get involved, but it's too late - their attacker is already upon you!</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_3">Despite their precautions, pirates have begun to harass the local Zoltan settlements across this sector. One such pirate spots your ship and moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_4">A ship with pirate markings demands your surrender. These are sad times when even Zoltan space is beset by pirates. You doubt these fools will be missed.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_5">You spot a pirate ship looting a small Zoltan cruiser. They spot you and move in to attack before your FTL drive has a chance to recharge.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_6">You jump just in time to witness a Zoltan ship's FTL drive overload. In their final moments they implore you not to get involved, but it's too late - their attacker is already upon you!</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_PIRATE_7">A ship with pirate markings demand that you surrender. These are sad times when even Zoltan space is beset by pirates. You doubt these fools will be missed.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_1">"Yes, yes, you've demonstrated your species' capacity for violence quite extensively, well done. If we reward your efforts will you bother someone else?"</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_2">The enemy ship hails; the vidscreen shows their bridge showered in sparks from malfunctioning equipment - it's safe to assume they're trying to surrender. Accept their offer?</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_3">Communications report that the Zoltan are broadcasting on all frequencies. The captain appears on screen and says, "Yes, I am not surprised, your species hardly looks enlightened. Fine. Take what you wish."</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_4">The Zoltan captain hails and mutters something about the border patrol force catching up with you someday; you're more interested in his offer of surrender.</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_5">"We assumed that your species' intelligence was directly proportional to your brute strength. We yield."</text>
<text name="text_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_6">"You have bested us. If only your species' efforts were put to use improving the galaxy rather than your military might."</text>

<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_HOME_c2_text">They are happy to take a look, and are able to offer some suggestions for improvements.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_HOME_text">The colony is a mining operation that specializes in FTL fuel. Robert's family, the head engineers, are excited to see him, and are very grateful for his return. Apparently he ran away to 'join the Federation' like his older brother, but was never accepted onto a ship.</text>

<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c1_c4_text">The Mantis is terrified at the sight of your crewmember. He immediately attacks his Engi rescuers, and your crewmember is forced to kill him. The Engi are grateful for your help and offer a small reward.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c1_c5_choice">(Mind Control) Use your Mind control System to calm him down.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c1_c5_text">The Mantis calms down and communicates thanks to the Engi and yourself for helping. He requests to be dropped off at a nearby planet, at the human colony where he was raised. They are grateful for his return and offer a reward.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c1_choice">Listen to their problem.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c1_text">"Found malfunctioning Mantis. Believes it is human. Will receive input only from human. Danger Evaluation: Extremely High. Provide assistance."</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_c2_choice">Explain that you can't do any programming and leave.</text>
<text name="event_CONFUSED_MANTIS_text">As soon as you jump into the system, you receive a hail from a nearby civilian Engi vessel. Their Captain appears on your screen: "Strange bug. Can you assist in debugging?"</text>

<text name="event_CONTACT_PIRATE_SALESMAN_c2_choice">This seems dangerous, leave.</text>
<text name="event_CONTACT_PIRATE_SALESMAN_c2_text">As soon as you start to reverse your ship, the pirate reveals hidden weaponry and sets off in pursuit. You'll have to fight him to escape!</text>

<text name="event_CONTACT_PIRATE_SALESMAN_text">The ship responds "Yes, we have an extensive stock! Come aboard and see our wares!"</text>
<text name="event_DEMO_END_text">Congratulations, that's the end of the training simulation! As a final lesson, you'll experience what it's like to be destroyed by a more powerful enemy. This is an unfinished version of the most powerful ship in the Rebel fleet, though it should still be sufficient to destroy your puny ship. And we've shutdown your engines as well, so there's no use trying to run away.</text>

<text name="event_EMPTY_STATION2_LIST_6_text">You dock with the station to take a look inside. However no sooner do you open the airlock than pirates burst in.

<text name="event_EMPTY_STATION2_c2_choice">Stay near the Beacon.</text>

<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_BLOW_2_text">Just as you hook up to refuel, the station ignites and explodes. Your own fuel reserve ignites, losing you precious fuel and damaging your ship.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_IGNORE_1_text">As you prepare to leave the system, a Pirate ship suddenly appears on scanners - it looks like it was attempting to use the platform as bait!</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_1_c1_choice">Accept it.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_1_c2_choice">Reject it.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_1_text">The platform makes an offer.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_2_c1_choice">Steal it.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_2_c1_text">If you take the fuel at least it won't fall into the hands of the Rebels. You breach the containment and access what remains of the fuel reserves.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_2_c2_choice">War doesn't justify abandoning one's values. You leave it alone.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_2_text">The automated platform seems to be damaged. You can likely steal as much fuel as remains.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_3_c1_choice">Quickly dock and refuel.</text>
<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_NORMAL_LIST_3_c2_choice">Give the station a wide berth and carry on.</text>

<text name="event_FUELING_STATION_PIRATE_LIST_1_c2_text">Pirates hidden on the station are confounded by your security locks, turning an attempted ambush into a fish-in-a-barrel firefight. You take control of the station and take its fuel reserves.</text>

<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_12">TIP: Shield Piercing -  Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shields System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_13">TIP: Choices -  Results of most choices have multiple outcomes. You can never be sure what will happen.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_14">TIP: Autofire -  Autofire will let a weapon maintain its target. Just keep an eye on your missile count!</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_15">TIP: Evasion -  Evading enemy shots is crucial, but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_16">TIP: Sensors -  If the ship goes dark, don't panic. Just fix the Sensors Subsystem.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_17">TIP: Drones -  If you're struggling against enemy Drones, target the Drone System to temporarily disable them.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_18">TIP: Beams -  Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit. Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when the enemy's shields are down.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_19">TIP: Fire -  If fire is spreading, consider opening airlocks and doors to vent the oxygen from parts of your ship. Fire is quickly extinguished without O2.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_2">TIP: Grinding Sectors -  It can be beneficial to stay in a Sector for as long as possible to improve the ship since each Sector is increasingly difficult.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_20">TIP: Health -  Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the Medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_21">TIP: Upgrades -  Don't forget to upgrade your ship! Often shields are the highest priority, but don't underestimate the usefulness of subsystems.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_22">TIP: Fuel -  Every jump consumes one unit of fuel, so keep an eye on your reserves. Buy fuel at stores to avoid being left stranded.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_23">TIP: Sound -  Go into the options menu to turn on or off the sound effects and music.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_24">TIP: Asteroids -  Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy Shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_25">TIP: Nebulas -  Passing through a Nebula will allow you to temporarily slow down the fleet advancement but they contain their own unique dangers.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_26">TIP: Solar Flares -  Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_27">TIP: Score -  Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_28">TIP: Augmentations -  Your ship can only hold 3 augmentations. They provide unique benefits to a system, the crew or the entire ship.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_29">TIP: Breaches -  If a room with a breach has no Oxygen, try opening all the doors surrounding it to make it less hazardous.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_3">TIP: Exits -  It's tempting to rush for the Sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each Sector as possible.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_30">TIP: Rebel Fleet -  The Rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_31">TIP: Ion Weapons -  Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_32">TIP: Bomb Weapons -  Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However, they affect only crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ship's hull.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_33">TIP: Door Subsystem -  Upgrading your doors will greatly reduce the chance of fire spreading between rooms and will significantly slow boarder movement.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_4">TIP: Targets -  Prioritize your targeting in combat. Weapons and Shields are usually the best choice, but if they're fleeing, hit their Engines or Piloting to prevent escape.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_5">TIP: Hidden Choices -  When you see a blue colored choice in an event, it's a special option that has been made available by your current equipment.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_6">TIP: System Damage -  When a System fully breaks due to fire or boarders, the hull also takes one damage.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_7">TIP: Power Bars -  Upgraded Systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_8">TIP: Weapons -  You can queue up an attack before the weapon is charged. It will fire when it's charged.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_9">TIP: Cloaking -  Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also increases your base evasion by 60.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_IPAD_1">TIP: Pausing -  Tap the PAUSE button at any time to pause the game. You can still issue orders to crew or manipulate system power while paused.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_IPAD_2">TIP: Selling -  Weapons, Drones and Augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Tap the SELL tab at the top.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_IPAD_3">TIP: Weapon Order -  Rearrange a Weapon or Drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The bottom-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_PC_1">TIP: Pausing -  Press SPACE at any time to pause the game. You can still issue orders to crew or manipulate system power while paused.</text>

<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_PC_3">TIP: Hotkeys -  You can charge or arm weapons using number hotkeys: The Weapon Slots are 1-4 on your keyboard, and the Drones are 5-7 (customizeable in the options).</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_PC_4">TIP: Font Size -  Pressing +/- (customizable in options) will let you change the event text size.</text>
<text name="text_TIPS_LIST_PC_5">TIP: Weapon Order -  Rearrange a Weapon or Drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The left-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
<text name="text_TRADER_UPGRADES_EXCHANGE_TEXT_1">"You look like a military vessel. We're trying to get back to our homes alive. I'm an engineer by trade and could try to improve your reactor if you have any extra supplies."</text>

<text name="text_WRECKAGE_TEXT_1">What at first seems to be a simple nebula is actually filled with a good amount of debris from a brutal exchange between several ships. Wreckage drifts by your screens and tumbles into the depths of the nebula to be lost to sight. It's hard to determine who the combatants were without closer investigation.</text>
<text name="text_WRECKAGE_TEXT_2">You have jumped into the aftermath of what seems to have been a brutal exchange between several ships.
